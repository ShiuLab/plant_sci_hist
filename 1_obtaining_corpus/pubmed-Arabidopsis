TI  - The functional specificity of ERECTA-family receptors in Arabidopsis stomatal
      development is ensured by molecular chaperones in the endoplasmic reticulum.

AB  - Stomata are epidermal pores that control gas exchange between plants and the
      atmosphere. In Arabidopsis, the ERECTA family (ERECTAf) receptors, including
      ERECTA, ERECTA-LIKE 1 (ERL1) and ERL2, redundantly play pivotal roles in
      enforcing the 'one-cell-spacing' rule. Accumulating evidence has demonstrated
      that the functional specificities of receptors are likely associated with their
      differential subcellular dynamics. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident
      chaperone complex SDF2-ERdj3B-BiP functions in many aspects of plant development.
      We employed pharmacological treatments combined with cell biological and
      biochemical approaches to demonstrate that the abundance of ERECTA was reduced in
      the erdj3b-1 mutant, but the localization and dynamics of ERECTA were not
      noticeably affected. By contrast, the erdj3b mutation caused the retention of
      ERL1/ERL2 in the ER. Furthermore, we found that the function of SDF2-ERdj3B-BiP
      is implicated with the distinct roles of ERECTAf receptors. Our findings
      establish that the ERECTAf receptor-mediated signaling in stomatal development is
      ensured by the activities of the ER quality control system, which preferentially 
      maintains the protein abundance of ERECTA and proper subcellular dynamics of
      ERL1/ERL2, prior to the receptors reaching their destination - the plasma
      membrane - to execute their functions.

TI  - SICKLE represses photomorphogenic development of Arabidopsis seedlings via HY5-
      and PIF4-mediated signaling.

LID - 10.1111/jipb.13329 [doi]
AB  - Arabidopsis CONSTITUTIVELY PHOTOMORPHOGENIC1 (COP1) and PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING
      FACTORs (PIFs) are negative regulators, and ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5 (HY5) is a
      positive regulator of seedling photomorphogenic development. Here, we report that
      SICKLE (SIC), a proline rich protein, acts as a novel negative regulator of
      photomorphogenesis. HY5 directly binds the SIC promoter and activates SIC
      expression in response to light. In turn, SIC physically interacts with HY5 and
      interferes with its transcriptional regulation of downstream target genes.
      Moreover, SIC interacts with PIF4 and promotes PIF4-activated transcription of
      itself. Interestingly, SIC is targeted by COP1 for 26S proteasome-mediated
      degradation in the dark. Collectively, our data demonstrate that light-induced
      SIC functions as a brake to prevent exaggerated light response via mediating HY5 
      and PIF4 signaling, and its degradation by COP1 in the dark avoid too strong
      inhibition on photomorphogenesis at the beginning of light exposure.

LID - 10.1080/15592324.2022.2092699 [doi]
AB  - The regulation of hypocotyl elongation is an important process in plant growth
      and development and depends on the activity of the plasma membrane (PM)
      H(+)-ATPase. In this study, we found that the Arabidopsis protein SOS3-LIKE
      CALCIUM BINDING PROTEIN3 (SCaBP3) negatively regulates PM H(+)-ATPase activity in
      yeast and hypocotyl elongation in dark-grown seedlings. Yeast two-hybrid assays
      showed that SCaBP3 interacts with representative members of the Arabidopsis PM
      H(+)-ATPase family. Experiments in RS-72 yeast showed that SCaBP3 negatively
      regulates PM H(+)-ATPase activity-dependent yeast cell growth. Hypocotyl
      elongation was promoted in the loss-of-function mutant scabp3 and inhibited in
      SCaBP3 overexpression lines of Arabidopsis. We propose that SCaBP3 modulates
      hypocotyl elongation by negatively regulating PM H(+)-ATPase activity.

AB  - Despite the adaptive and taxonomic relevance of the natural diversity for
      trichome patterning and morphology, the molecular and evolutionary mechanisms
      underlying these traits remain mostly unknown, particularly in organs other than 
      leaves. In this study, we address the ecological, genetic and molecular bases of 
      the natural variation for trichome patterning and branching in multiple organs of
      Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). To this end, we characterized a collection of
      191 accessions and carried out environmental and genome-wide association (GWA)
      analyses. Trichome amount in different organs correlated negatively with
      precipitation in distinct seasons, thus suggesting a precise fit between trichome
      patterning and climate throughout the Arabidopsis life cycle. In addition, GWA
      analyses showed small overlapping between the genes associated with different
      organs, indicating partly independent genetic bases for vegetative and
      reproductive phases. These analyses identified a complex locus on chromosome 2,
      where two adjacent MYB genes (ETC2 and TCL1) displayed differential effects on
      trichome patterning in several organs. Furthermore, analyses of transgenic lines 
      carrying different natural alleles demonstrated that TCL1 accounts for the
      variation for trichome patterning in all organs, and for stem trichome branching.
      By contrast, two other MYB genes (TRY and GL1), mainly showed effects on trichome
      patterning or branching, respectively.

TI  - Preinvasive nonhost resistance of Arabidopsis against melanized
      appressorium-mediated entry of multiple nonadapted Colletotrichum fungi.
PG  - 2018218
LID - 10.1080/15592324.2021.2018218 [doi]
AB  - Nonhost plants effectively block a vast number of nonadapted fungal pathogens at 
      the preinvasive stage. On the host plants, adapted fungal pathogens such as
      Colletotrichum species invade into plant epidermal cell by penetration peg
      developed from melanized appressorium, followed by invasive hyphal extension. I
      reported nonadapted Colletotrichum fungi that showed an increased rate of
      melanized appressorium-mediated entry (MAE) into the pen2 mutant of nonhost
      Arabidopsis thaliana (hereafter Arabidopsis). It was also found that other
      MAE-type nonadapted Colletotrichum fungi with no penetration into the pen2 mutant
      invaded Arabidopsis in the presence of additional mutations such as edr1, gsh1,
      eds5, cas, and chup1 in the pen2 background. Thus, many immune components
      contribute to the preinvasive nonhost resistance (NHR) of Arabidopsis against
      Colletotrichum MAE, and PEN2-related defense takes priority over other defense
      pathways. Here, I show that among the above nonadapted fungi, Colletotrichum
      nymphaeae PL1-1-b exhibited relatively lower incompatibility with the nonhost
      Arabidopsis with increased MAE in each single mutant of edr1, gsh1, eds5, and
      cas, although other nonadapted fungi almost never invaded these single mutants.
      Based on the relationships between Colletotrichum MAE and the Arabidopsis
      immune-related components, Colletotrichum-Arabidopsis incompatibility and
      multilayered immunity in the preinvasive NHR of Arabidopsis are discussed in this
      study.

TI  - BTB and TAZ domain protein BT4 positively regulates the resistance to Botrytis
      cinerea in Arabidopsis.

AB  - BT4 gene was identified to play an important role in Arabidopsis resistance to
      pst DC3000 in preliminary studies. However, the specific function and molecular
      mechanism of BT4 gene in regulation of Arabidopsis resistance to Botrytis cinerea
      had not been described to date. In this study, we found that the expression of
      BT4 was induced by wounding and B. cinerea inoculation in Arabidopsis. After
      inoculated with B. cinerea, T-DNA insertion mutants of the BT4 gene, bt4, showed 
      significant susceptibility symptoms, whereas no significant symptoms were found
      in wild-type (WT), the complemented transgenic plants (CE), and the
      overexpression transgenic plants (OE). After inoculated with B. cinerea, the
      expression levels of JAR1 and PDF1.2 genes in bt4 mutant were induced; however,
      the expression levels of these genes in bt4 mutant were significantly lower than 
      those in the WT, CE, and OE. These results indicated that the BT4 positively
      regulate the expression of genes in JA/ET signaling pathways. Therefore, the BT4 
      may be involved in the regulation of JA/ET signaling pathways to affect
      Arabidopsis resistance to B. cinerea.

AB  - Phosphorus is an important macronutrient required for plant growth and
      development. It is absorbed by the roots in the form of inorganic phosphate (Pi).
      Under Pi limiting conditions, plants activate the Phosphate Starvation Response
      (PSR) system to enhance Pi acquisition. The NITROGEN LIMITATION ADAPTION (NLA)
      gene is a component of the Arabidopsis PSR, and its expression is
      post-transcriptionally regulated by miR827. We show that loss-of-function of NLA 
      and MIR827 overexpression increases Pi level and enhances resistance to infection
      by the fungal pathogen Plectosphaerella cucumerina in Arabidopsis. Upon pathogen 
      infection, high Pi plants (e.g. nla plants and wild type plants grown under high 
      Pi supply) showed enhanced callose deposition. High Pi plants also exhibited
      superinduction of camalexin biosynthesis genes which is consistent with increased
      levels of camalexin during pathogen infection. Pathogen infection and treatment
      with fungal elicitors, triggered up-regulation of MIR827 and down-regulation of
      NLA expression. Under non-infection conditions, the nla plants showed increased
      levels of SA and JA compared with wild type plants, their levels further
      increasing upon pathogen infection. Overall, the outcomes of this study suggest
      that NLA plays a role in Arabidopsis immunity, while supporting convergence
      between Pi signaling and immune signaling in Arabidopsis.

TI  - Altered collective mitochondrial dynamics in the Arabidopsis msh1 mutant
      compromising organelle DNA maintenance.
PG  - 5428-5439
LID - 10.1093/jxb/erac250 [doi]
AB  - Mitochondria form highly dynamic populations in the cells of plants (and almost
      all eukaryotes). The characteristics and benefits of this collective behaviour,
      and how it is influenced by nuclear features, remain to be fully elucidated.
      Here, we use a recently developed quantitative approach to reveal and analyse the
      physical and collective 'social' dynamics of mitochondria in an Arabidopsis msh1 
      mutant where the organelle DNA maintenance machinery is compromised. We use a
      newly created line combining the msh1 mutant with mitochondrially targeted green 
      fluorescent protein (GFP), and characterize mitochondrial dynamics with a
      combination of single-cell time-lapse microscopy, computational tracking, and
      network analysis. The collective physical behaviour of msh1 mitochondria is
      altered from that of the wild type in several ways: mitochondria become less
      evenly spread, and networks of inter-mitochondrial encounters become more
      connected, with greater potential efficiency for inter-organelle
      exchange-reflecting a potential compensatory mechanism for the genetic challenge 
      to the mitochondrial DNA population, supporting more inter-organelle exchange. We
      find that these changes are similar to those observed in friendly, where
      mitochondrial dynamics are altered by a physical perturbation, suggesting that
      this shift to higher connectivity may reflect a general response to mitochondrial
      challenges, where physical dynamics of mitochondria may be altered to control the
      genetic structure of the mtDNA population.

TI  - miR156-independent repression of the ageing pathway by longevity-promoting AHL
      proteins in Arabidopsis.
PG  - 2424-2438
LID - 10.1111/nph.18292 [doi]
AB  - Plants age by developmental phase changes. In Arabidopsis, the juvenile to adult 
      vegetative phase change (VPC) is marked by clear heteroblastic changes in leaves.
      VPC and the subsequent vegetative to reproductive phase change are promoted by
      SQUAMOSA PROMOTOR BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE (SPL) transcription factors and repressed 
      by miR156/157 targeting SPL transcripts. By genetic, phenotypic, and gene
      expression analyses, we studied the role of the longevity-promoting AT-HOOK MOTIF
      NUCLEAR LOCALIZED 15 (AHL15) and family members in SPL-driven plant ageing.
      Arabidopsis ahl loss-of-function mutants showed accelerated VPC and flowering,
      whereas AHL15 overexpression delayed these phase changes. Expression analysis and
      tissue-specific AHL15 overexpression revealed that AHL15 affects VPC and
      flowering time directly through its expression in the shoot apical meristem and
      young leaves, and that AHL15 represses SPL2/9/13/15 gene expression in a
      miR156/157-independent manner. The juvenile traits of spl loss-of-function
      mutants appeared to depend on enhanced expression of the AHL15 gene, whereas SPL 
      activity prevented vegetative growth from axillary meristem by repressing AHL15
      expression. Our results place AHL15 and close family members together with SPLs
      in a reciprocal regulatory feedback loop that modulates VPC, flowering time, and 
      axillary meristem development in response to both internal and external signals.

TI  - Replication protein RPA2A regulates floral transition by cooperating with PRC2 in
      Arabidopsis.
PG  - 2439-2453
LID - 10.1111/nph.18279 [doi]
AB  - RPA2A is a subunit of the conserved heterotrimeric replication protein A (RPA) in
      Arabidopsis, which is an essential replisome component that binds to
      single-stranded DNA during DNA replication. RPA2A controls a set of developmental
      processes, but the underlying mechanism is largely unknown. Here we show that
      RPA2A represses key flowering genes including FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT), AGAMOUS
      (AG) and AGAMOUS LIKE 71 (AGL71) to suppress floral transition by cooperating
      with the PRC2 complex. RPA2A is vigorously expressed in dividing cells and
      required for correct DNA replication. Mutation of RPA2A leads to early flowering,
      which is dependent on ectopic expression of key flowering genes including FT
      molecularly and genetically. RPA2A and PRC2 have common target genes including
      FT, AG and AGL71 supported using genetic analysis, transcriptome profiling and
      H3K27me3 ChIP-seq analysis. Furthermore, RPA2A physically interacts with PRC2
      components CLF, EMF2 and MSI1, which recruits CLF to the chromatin loci of FT, AG
      and AGL71. Together, our results show that the replication protein RPA2A recruits
      PRC2 to key flowering genes through physical protein interaction, thereby
      repressing the expression of these genes to suppress floral transition in
      Arabidopsis.

AB  - In eukaryotic cells, the accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins in the
      endoplasmic reticulum (ER) results in ER stress that induces a cascade of
      reactions called the unfolded protein response (UPR). In Arabidopsis, the most
      conserved UPR sensor, Inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), responds to both
      abiotic- and biotic-induced ER stress. Guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G
      proteins) constitute another universal and conserved family of signal transducers
      that have been extensively investigated due to their ubiquitous presence and
      diverse nature of action. Arabidopsis GTP-binding protein beta1 (AGB1) is the
      only G-protein beta-subunit encoded by the Arabidopsis genome that is involved in
      numerous signaling pathways. Mounting evidence suggests the existence of a
      crosstalk between IRE1 and G protein signaling during ER stress. AGB1 has
      previously been shown to control a distinct UPR pathway independently of IRE1
      when treated with an ER stress inducer tunicamycin. Our results obtained with
      combinatorial knockout mutants support the hypothesis that both IRE1 and AGB1
      synergistically contribute to ER stress responses chemically induced by
      dithiothreitol (DTT) as well as to the immune responses against a phytopathogenic
      bacterium Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato strain DC3000. Our study highlights the
      crosstalk between the plant UPR transducers under abiotic and biotic stress.

      regulate Arabidopsis growth.

AB  - Light is a crucial exogenous signal sensed by cryptochrome (CRY) blue light
      receptors to modulate growth and the circadian clock in plants and animals.
      However, how CRYs interpret light quantity to regulate growth in plants remains
      poorly understood. Furthermore, CRY2 protein levels and activity are tightly
      regulated in light to fine-tune hypocotyl growth; however, details of the
      mechanisms that explain precise control of CRY2 levels are not fully understood. 
      We show that in Arabidopsis, UBP12 and UBP13 deubiquitinases physically interact 
      with CRY2 in light. UBP12/13 negatively regulates CRY2 by promoting its
      ubiquitination and turnover to modulate hypocotyl growth. Growth and development 
      were explicitly affected in blue light when UBP12/13 were disrupted or
      overexpressed, indicating their role alongside CRY2. UBP12/13 also interacted
      with and stabilized COP1, which is partially required for CRY2 turnover. Our
      combined genetic and molecular data support a mechanistic model in which UBP12/13
      interact with CRY2 and COP1, leading to the stabilization of COP1. Stabilized
      COP1 then promotes the ubiquitination and degradation of CRY2 under blue light.
      Despite decades of studies on deubiquitinases, the knowledge of how their
      activity is regulated is limited. Our study provides insight into how exogenous
      signals and ligands, along with their receptors, regulate deubiquitinase activity
      by protein-protein interaction. Collectively, our results provide a framework of 
      cryptochromes and deubiquitinases to detect and interpret light signals to
      control plant growth at the most appropriate time.

AB  - Phytocytokines are endogenous danger peptides that are actively released after a 
      pest or pathogen attack, triggering an amplification of plant immune responses.
      Here, we found that Systemin, a peptide from tomato, has a substantial impact at 
      the molecular level in Arabidopsis plants that leads to induced resistance
      against Plectosphaerella cucumerina. Using transcriptional and metabolomics
      approaches, and loss-of-function mutants to analyse the molecular mechanisms
      underlying induced resistance against the necrotroph, we decipher the enhanced
      molecular responses in Systemin-treated plants following infection. Some protein 
      complexes involved in the response to other damage signals, including the
      BAK1-BIK1 protein complex and heterotrimeric G proteins, as well as MPK
      activation, were among the early signalling events triggered by Systemin in
      Arabidopsis upon infection. Non-targeted analysis of the late responses
      underlying Systemin-Induced Resistance(1) (Sys-IR) showed that phenolic and
      indolic compounds were the most representative groups in the Systemin metabolic
      fingerprint. Lack of flavonoids resulted in the impairment of Sys-IR. On the
      other hand, some indolic compounds showed a priming profile and were also
      essential for functional Sys-IR. Evidence presented here shows that plants can
      sense heterologous peptides from other species as danger signals driving the
      participation of common protein cascades activated in the PTI and promoting
      enhanced resistance against necrotrophic fungus.

AB  - Medicago truncatula is a model system for legume plants, which has substantially 
      expanded the genome relative to the prototypical model dicot plant, Arabidopsis
      thaliana. An essential transcriptional regulator, FCP1 (transcription factor
      IIF-interacting RNA polymerase II carboxyl-terminal phosphatase 1) ortholog, is
      encoded by a single essential gene CPL4 (CTD-phosphatase-like 4), whereas M.
      truncatula genome contains four genes homologous to FCP1/AtCPL4, and splicing
      variants of MtCPL4 are observed. Functional diversification of MtCPL4 family
      proteins was analyzed using recombinant proteins (MtCPL4a1, MtCPL4a2, and
      MtCPL4b) produced in Arabidopsis cell culture system developed for plant protein 
      overexpression. In vitro CTD phosphatase assay using highly purified MtCPL4
      preparations revealed a potent CTD phosphatase activity in MtCPL4b, but not two
      splicing variants of MtCPL4a. On the other hand, in planta binding assay to RNA
      polymerase II (pol II) revealed a greater pol II-binding activity of both MtCPL4a
      variants. Our results indicate functional diversification of MtCPL4 isoforms and 
      suggest the presence of a large number of functionally specialized
      CTD-phosphatase-like proteins in plants.

TI  - Calcium affects uranium responses in Arabidopsis thaliana: From distribution to
      toxicity.

AB  - Uranium, a heavy metal and primordial radionuclide, is present in surface waters 
      and soils both naturally and due to industrial activities. Uranium is known to be
      toxic to plants and its uptake and toxicity can be influenced by multiple factors
      such as pH and the presence of different ions. However, the precise role of the
      different ions in uranium uptake is not yet known. Here we investigated whether
      calcium influences uranium uptake and toxicity in the terrestrial plant
      Arabidopsis thaliana. To this end, A. thaliana plants were exposed to different
      calcium and uranium concentrations and furthermore, calcium channels were blocked
      using the calcium channel blocker lanthanum chloride (LaCl3). Fresh weight,
      relative growth rate, concentration of nutrients and uranium and gene expression 
      of oxidative stress-related genes and calcium transporters were determined in
      roots and shoots. Calcium affected plant growth and oxidative stress in both
      control (no uranium) and uranium-exposed plants. In shoots, this was influenced
      by the total calcium concentration, but not by the different tested uranium
      concentrations. Uranium in turn did influence calcium uptake and distribution.
      Uranium-exposed plants grown in a medium with a higher calcium concentration
      showed an increase in gene expression of NADPH oxidases RBOHC and RBOHE and
      calcium transporter CAX7 after uranium exposure. In roots, these
      calcium-dependent responses in gene expression were not observed. This indicates 
      that calcium indeed affects uranium toxicity, but only in shoots. In addition, a 
      clear influence of uranium and LaCl3 (separately and combined) on the expression 
      of calcium transporters was observed.

TI  - PICKLE associates with histone deacetylase 9 to mediate vegetative phase change
      in Arabidopsis.
PG  - 1070-1081
LID - 10.1111/nph.18174 [doi]
AB  - The juvenile-to-adult vegetative phase change in flowering plants is mediated by 
      a decrease in miR156 levels. Downregulation of MIR156A/MIR156C, the two major
      sources of miR156, is accompanied by a decrease in acetylation of histone 3
      lysine 27 (H3K27ac) and an increase in trimethylation of H3K27 (H3K27me3) at
      MIR156A/MIR156C in Arabidopsis. Here, we show that histone deacetylase 9 (HDA9)
      is recruited to MIR156A/MIR156C during the juvenile phase and associates with the
      CHD3 chromatin remodeler PICKLE (PKL) to erase H3K27ac at MIR156A/MIR156C. H2Aub 
      and H3K27me3 become enriched at MIR156A/MIR156C, and the recruitment of Polycomb 
      Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) to MIR156A/MIR156C is partially dependent on the
      activities of PKL and HDA9. Our results suggest that PKL associates with histone 
      deacetylases to erase H3K27ac and promote PRC1 and PRC2 activities to mediate
      vegetative phase change and maintain plants in the adult phase after the phase
      transition.

TI  - Label-Free Quantitative Proteomics Reveal the Involvement of PRT6 in Arabidopsis 
      thaliana Seed Responsiveness to Ethylene.
LID - 9352 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23169352 [doi]
AB  - In Arabidopsis thaliana, the breaking of seed dormancy in wild type (Col-0) by
      ethylene at 100 muL L(-1) required at least 30 h application. A mutant of the
      proteolytic N-degron pathway, lacking the E3 ligase PROTEOLYSIS 6 (PRT6), was
      investigated for its role in ethylene-triggered changes in proteomes during seed 
      germination. Label-free quantitative proteomics was carried out on dormant wild
      type Col-0 and prt6 seeds treated with (+) or without (-) ethylene. After 16 h,
      1737 proteins were identified, but none was significantly different in protein
      levels in response to ethylene. After longer ethylene treatment (30 h), 2552
      proteins were identified, and 619 Differentially Expressed Proteins (DEPs) had
      significant differences in protein abundances between ethylene treatments and
      genotypes. In Col, 587 DEPs were enriched for those involved in signal perception
      and transduction, reserve mobilization and new material generation, which
      potentially contributed to seed germination. DEPs up-regulated by ethylene in Col
      included S-adenosylmethionine synthase 1, methionine adenosyltransferase 3 and
      ACC oxidase involved in ethylene synthesis and of Pyrabactin Resistance1 acting
      as an ABA receptor, while DEPs down-regulated by ethylene in Col included
      aldehyde oxidase 4 involved in ABA synthesis. In contrast, in prt6 seeds,
      ethylene did not result in strong proteomic changes with only 30 DEPs. Taken
      together, the present work demonstrates that the proteolytic N-degron pathway is 
      essential for ethylene-mediated reprogramming of seed proteomes during
      germination.

TI  - AtEAU1 and AtEAU2, Two EAR Motif-Containing ABA Up-Regulated Novel Transcription 
      Repressors Regulate ABA Response in Arabidopsis.
LID - 9053 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23169053 [doi]
AB  - EAR (Ethylene-responsive element binding factor-associated Amphiphilic
      Repression) motif-containing transcription repressors have been shown to regulate
      plant growth and development, and plant responses to plant hormones and
      environmental stresses including biotic and abiotic stresses. However, the
      functions of most EAR-motif-containing proteins remain largely uncharacterized.
      The plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) also plays important roles in regulating
      plant responses to abiotic stresses via activation/repression of ABA-responsive
      genes. We report here the identification and functional characterization of two
      ABA-responsive EAR motif-containing protein genes, AtEAU1 (Arabidopsis
      thaliana&amp;nbsp;EAR motif-containing ABAUp-regulated 1) and AtEAU2.
      Quantitative RT-PCR results show that the expressions of AtEAU1 and AtEAU2 were
      increased by ABA treatment, and were decreased in the ABA biosynthesis mutant
      aba1-5. Assays in transfected Arabidopsis protoplasts show that both AtEAU1 and
      AtEAU2 were specifically localized in the nucleus, and when recruited to the
      promoter region of the reporter gene by a fused DNA binding domain, repressed
      reporter gene expression. By using T-DNA insertion mutants and a gene-edited
      transgene-free mutant generated by CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing, we performed ABA
      sensitivity assays, and found that ABA sensitivity in the both ateau1 and ateau2 
      single mutants was increased in seedling greening assays. ABA sensitivity in the 
      ateau1&amp;nbsp;ateau2 double mutants was also increased, but was largely similar
      to the ateau1 single mutants. On the other hand, all the mutants showed a wild
      type response to ABA in root elongation assays. Quantitative RT-PCR results show 
      that the expression level of PYL4, an ABA receptor gene was increased, whereas
      that of ABI2, a PP2C gene was decreased in the ateau1 and ateau1 single, and the 
      ateau1&amp;nbsp;ateau2 double mutants. In summary, our results suggest that
      AtEAU1 and AtEAU2 are ABA-response genes, and AtEAU1 and AtEAU2 are novel EAR
      motif-containing transcription repressors that negatively regulate ABA responses 
      in Arabidopsis, likely by regulating the expression of some ABA signaling key
      regulator genes.

AB  - Guard-cell-type aluminium-activated malate transporters (ALMTs) are involved in
      stomatal closure by exporting anions from guard cells. However, their
      physiological and electrophysiological functions are yet to be explored. Here, we
      analysed the physiological and electrophysiological properties of the ALMT
      channels in Arabidopsis and tomato (Solanum lycopersicum). SlALMT11 was
      specifically expressed in tomato guard cells. External malate-induced stomatal
      closure was impaired in ALMT-suppressed lines of tomato and Arabidopsis, although
      abscisic acid did not influence the stomatal response in SlALMT11-knock-down
      tomato lines. Electrophysiological analyses in Xenopus oocytes showed that
      SlALMT11 and AtALMT12/QUAC1 exhibited characteristic bell-shaped current-voltage 
      patterns dependent on extracellular malate, fumarate, and citrate. Both ALMTs
      could transport malate, fumarate, and succinate, but not citrate, suggesting that
      the guard-cell-type ALMTs are dicarboxylic anion channels activated by
      extracellular organic acids. The truncation of acidic amino acids, Asp or Glu,
      from the C-terminal end of SlALMT11 or AtALMT12/QUAC1 led to the disappearance of
      the bell-shaped current-voltage patterns. Our findings establish that
      malate-activated stomatal closure is mediated by guard-cell-type ALMT channels
      that require an acidic amino acid in the C-terminus as a candidate voltage sensor
      in both tomato and Arabidopsis.

TI  - Expression of a Pennisetum glaucum gene DREB2A confers enhanced heat, drought and
      salinity tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis.
PG  - 7347-7358
LID - 10.1007/s11033-022-07527-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum) is an essential cereal crop, whose 
      growth and yield are not impacted by abiotic stresses, such as drought, heat, and
      cold. The DREB transcription factors (TF) are some of the largest groups of TFs
      in plants and play varied roles in plant stress response and signal transduction.
      METHODS AND RESULTS: In the present study, PgDREB2A gene encoding a DREB
      transcription factor in pearl millet was functionally characterized in
      Arabidopsis. DREB2A proteins contain a conserved domain that binds toethylene
      responsive element binding factors. Three different T1 transgenic lines
      overexpressing PgDREB2A gene were identified by Southern blot. Quantitative
      real-time polymerase chain reaction exhibited that PgDREB2A could be induced
      under drought conditions. As compared with the control, PgDREB2A overexpressing
      transgenic Arabidopsis showed increased rate of seed germination and root growth 
      in transgenic lines under higher concentrations of mannitol, NaCl, ABA, heat and 
      cold stress. Additionally, PgDREB2A transgenic lines showed enhanced durability
      after rehydration and tolerance to drought and salt stress was augmented with
      increased proline and reduced MDA build-up and diminishing water loss.
      CONCLUSIONS: Results from this study suggested that PgDREB2A as a transcription
      factor may improve endurance to various abiotic stresses and can be employed for 
      developing crops tolerant to abiotic stresses.

AB  - Environmental stresses restrict plant growth and development and decrease crop
      yield. The circadian clock is associated with the ability of a plant to adapt to 
      daily environmental fluctuations and the production and consumption of energy.
      Here, we investigated the role of Arabidopsis Universal Stress Protein (USP;
      At3g53990) in the circadian regulation of nuclear clock genes. The Arabidopsis
      usp knockout mutant line exhibited critically diminished circadian amplitude of
      the central oscillator CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED 1 (CCA1) but enhanced the
      amplitude of TIMING OF CAB EXPRESSION 1 (TOC1). However, the expression of USP
      under the control of its own promoter restored the circadian timing of both
      genes, suggesting that USP regulates the circadian rhythm of Arabidopsis central 
      clock genes, CCA1 and TOC1.

TI  - Extracellular ATP targets Arabidopsis RIBONUCLEASE 1 to suppress mycotoxin
      stress-induced cell death.
PG  - 1531-1542
LID - 10.1111/nph.18211 [doi]
AB  - Extracellular ATP is a purinergic signal with important functions in regulating
      plant growth and stress-adaptive responses, including programmed cell death.
      While signalling events proximate to receptor activation at the plasma membrane
      have been characterised, downstream protein targets and the mechanism of cell
      death activation/regulation are unknown. We designed a proteomic screen to
      identify ATP-responsive proteins in Arabidopsis cell cultures exposed to
      mycotoxin stress via fumonisin B1 (FB1) application. Arabidopsis RIBONUCLEASE 1
      (RNS1) was identified by the screen, and transgenic plants overexpressing native 
      RNS1 showed greater susceptibility to FB1, while a gene knockout rns1 mutant and 
      antisense RNS1 transgenic plants were resistant to FB1-induced cell death. Native
      RNS1 complemented rns1 mutants and restored the cell death response to FB1, while
      a catalytically inactive version of the ribonuclease could not. The FB1
      resistance of salicylic acid (SA)-depleted nahG-expressing plants was abolished
      by transformation with native RNS1, but not the catalytically dead version. The
      mechanism of FB1-induced cell death is activation of RNS1-dependent RNA cleavage,
      which is blocked by ATP via RNS1 suppression, or enhanced by SA through induction
      of RNS1 expression. Our study reveals RNS1 as a previously unknown convergence
      point of ATP and SA signalling in the regulation of stress-induced cell death.

TI  - ANGUSTIFOLIA negatively regulates resistance to Sclerotinia sclerotiorum via
      modulation of PTI and JA signalling pathways in Arabidopsis thaliana.
PG  - 1091-1106
LID - 10.1111/mpp.13222 [doi]
AB  - Sclerotinia sclerotiorum is a devastating pathogen that infects a broad range of 
      host plants. The mechanism underlying plant defence against fungal invasion is
      still not well characterized. Here, we report that ANGUSTIFOLIA (AN), a CtBP
      family member, plays a role in the defence against S. sclerotiorum attack.
      Arabidopsis an mutants exhibited stronger resistance to S. sclerotiorum at the
      early stage of infection than wild-type plants. Accordingly, an mutants exhibited
      stronger activation of pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP)-triggered
      immunity (PTI) responses, including mitogen-activated protein kinase activation, 
      reactive oxygen species accumulation, callose deposition, and the expression of
      PTI-responsive genes, upon treatment with PAMPs/microbe-associated molecular
      patterns. Moreover, Arabidopsis lines overexpressing AN were more susceptible to 
      S. sclerotiorum and showed defective PTI responses. Our luminometry, bimolecular 
      fluorescence complementation, coimmunoprecipitation, and in vitro pull-down
      assays indicate that AN interacts with allene oxide cyclases (AOC), essential
      enzymes involved in jasmonic acid (JA) biosynthesis, negatively regulating JA
      biosynthesis in response to S. sclerotiorum infection. This work reveals AN is a 
      negative regulator of the AOC-mediated JA signalling pathway and PTI activation.

AB  - The nitrogen utilization efficiency of plants varies depending on the plant
      species. In modern agriculture, nitrogen fertilizer is used to increase crop
      production, with the amount of fertilizer addition increasing steadily worldwide.
      This study included the two most used ecotypes of Arabidopsis thaliana, Landsberg
      erecta (Ler) and Col-0, which were used to identify differences at the molecular 
      level. We found that the efficiency of nitrogen utilization and salt stress
      resistance differed between these two ecotypes of the same species. We
      demonstrated distinct salt stress resistance between Ler and Col-0 depending on
      the differences in nitrate level, which was explained by different regulation of 
      the NIA2 gene expression in these two ecotypes. Our results demonstrate that the 
      genes and promoters regulate expression of these genes and contribute to trait
      differences. Further studies are required on genes and promoter elements for an
      improved understanding of the salinity stress resistance mechanism in plants.

TI  - Comparative Transcriptome Analysis of CMV or 2b-Deficient CMV-Infected dcl2dcl4
      Reveals the Effects of Viral Infection on Symptom Induction in Arabidopsis
      thaliana.
LID - 1582 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14071582 [doi]
AB  - Due to the impaired antiviral RNAi, the dcl2dcl4 (dcl2/4) mutant is highly
      susceptible to viruses deficient of the viral suppressor of the RNA silencing
      (VSR) contrast to wild-type Arabidopsis. It was found that more severe disease
      symptoms were induced in dcl2/4 infected with VSR-deficient CMV (CMV-Delta2b or
      CMV-2aTDelta2b) compared to wild-type Arabidopsis infected with intact CMV. In
      order to investigate the underlying mechanism, comparative transcriptome analysis
      was performed with Col-0 and dcl2/4 that were infected by CMV, CMV-Delta2b and
      CMV-2aTDelta2b, respectively. Our analysis showed that the systematic infection
      of CMV, CMV-Delta2b and CMV-2aTDelta2b could cause hypoxia response and reduce
      photosynthesis. Asymptomatic infections of CMV-Delta2b or CMV-2aTDelta2b in
      Columbia (Col-0) promoted the expression of cell division-related genes and
      suppressed the transcription of metabolism and acquired resistance genes. On the 
      other hand, immunity and resistance genes were highly induced, but photosynthesis
      and polysaccharide metabolism-related genes were suppressed in diseased plants.
      More interestingly, cell wall reorganization was specifically caused in modestly 
      diseased Col-0 infected by CMV and a strong activation of SA signaling were
      correspondingly induced in severely diseased dcl2/4 by CMV or CMV mutants. Thus, 
      our research revealed the nature of the Arabidopsis-CMV interaction at the
      transcriptome level and could provide new clues in symptom development and
      antiviral defense in plants.

TI  - CALMODULIN1 and WRKY53 Function in Plant Defense by Negatively Regulating the
      Jasmonic Acid Biosynthesis Pathway in Arabidopsis.
LID - 7718 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23147718 [doi]
AB  - Jasmonic acid (JA) is an important hormone that functions in plant defense. cam1 
      and wrky53 mutants were more resistant to Spodoptera littoralis than in the
      wild-type (WT) Arabidopsis group. In addition, JA concentration in cam1 and
      wrky53 mutants was higher compared with the WT group. To explore how these two
      proteins affect the resistance of Arabidopsis plants, we used a yeast two-hybrid 
      assay, firefly luciferase complementation imaging assay and in vitro pull-down
      assay confirming that calmodulin 1 (CAM1) interacted with WRKY53. However, these 
      two proteins separate when calcium concentration increases in Arabidopsis leaf
      cells. Then, electrophoretic mobility shift assay and luciferase activation assay
      were used to verify that WRKY53 could bind to lipoxygenases 3 (LOX3) and
      lipoxygenases 4 (LOX4) gene promoters and negatively regulate gene expression.
      This study reveals that CAM1 and WRKY53 negatively regulate plant resistance to
      herbivory by regulating the JA biosynthesis pathway via the dissociation of
      CAM1-WRKY53, then the released WRKY53 binds to the LOXs promoters to negatively
      regulate LOXs gene expression. This study reveals WRKY53's mechanism in insect
      resistance, a new light on the function of WRKY53.

TI  - ARF2 positively regulates flavonols and proanthocyanidins biosynthesis in
      Arabidopsis thaliana.
PG  - 44
LID - 10.1007/s00425-022-03936-w [doi]
AB  - MAIN CONCLUSION: Auxin response factor 2 acts as a positive regulator to
      fine-tune the spatial and temporal accumulation of flavonoid compounds, mainly
      flavonols and proanthocyanidins in Arabidopsis. Auxin response factor (ARF)
      proteins are reported to involve in auxin-mediated regulation of flavonoid
      biosynthesis. However, the detailed regulation mechanism of ARF remains still
      unknown. Here, we provide genetic and molecular evidence that one of the
      twenty-three ARF members-ARF2-positively regulates flavonoid biosynthesis at
      multi-level in tissue-specific manner in Arabidopsis thaliana. Loss-of-function
      mutation of ARF2 led to significant reduction in flavonoid content (e.g.,
      flavonols and proanthocyanidins) in the seedlings and seeds of the Arabidopsis
      arf2 mutants. Over-expression of ARF2 increased flavonols and proanthocyanidins
      content in Arabidopsis. Additionally, the changes of flavonoid content correlate 
      well with the transcript abundance of several regulatory genes (e.g., MYB11,
      MYB12, MYB111, TT2, and GL3), and key biosynthetic genes (e.g., CHS, F3'H, FLS,
      ANS, ANR, TT12, TT19, and TT15), in the arf2 mutant and ARF2 over-expression
      lines. Transient transactivation assays with site-directed mutagenesis confirmed 
      that ARF2 directly regulates the expression of MYB12 and FLS genes in the
      flavonol pathway and ANR in the proanthocyanidin pathway, and indirectly
      regulates MYB11 and MYB111 genes in the flavonol pathway, and ANS, TT12, TT19 and
      TT15 genes in the proanthocyanidin pathway. Further genetic results indicated
      that ARF2 acts upstream of MYB12 to regulate flavonol accumulation, and of TT2 to
      regulate proanthocyanidins accumulation. In particular, yeast two-hybrid assays
      revealed that ARF2 physically interacts with TT2, a master regulator of
      proanthocyanidins biosynthesis. Combined together, these results indicated that
      ARF2 functions as a positive regulator for the fine-tuned spatial and temporal
      regulation of flavonoids (mainly flavonols and proanthocyanidins) accumulation in
      Arabidopsis.

      Arabidopsis.
PG  - 28
LID - 10.1007/s00425-022-03945-9 [doi]
AB  - KEY MESSAGE: AtMYB31, a R2R3-MYB transcription factor that modulates wax
      biosynthesis in reproductive tissues, is involved in seed development in
      Arabidopsis. R2R3-MYB transcription factors play important roles in plant
      development; yet, the exact role of each of them remains to be resolved. Here we 
      report that the Arabidopsis AtMYB31 is required for wax biosynthesis in epidermis
      of reproductive tissues, and is involved in seed development. AtMYB31 was
      ubiquitously expressed in both vegetative and reproductive tissues with higher
      expression levels in siliques and seeds, while AtMYB31 was localized to the
      nucleus and cytoplasm. Loss of function of AtMYB31 reduced wax accumulation in
      the epidermis of silique and flower tissues, disrupted seed coat epidermal wall
      development and mucilage production, altered seed proanthocyanidin and polyester 
      content. AtMYB31 could direct activate expressions of several wax biosynthetic
      target genes. Altogether, AtMYB31, a R2R3-MYB transcription factor, regulates
      seed development in Arabidopsis.

AB  - Hydrogen (H2) is a new signaling molecule that regulates stomatal closure via
      stimulating the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO)
      in Arabidopsis thaliana. GPA1 is the sole heterotrimeric G protein canonical
      alpha subunit found in Arabidopsis genome and functions in stomatal closure.
      Here, we estimated a possible role of Arabidopsis GPA1 in hydrogen-rich water
      (HRW)-induced stomatal closure. Our data indicated that HRW induced significant
      stomatal closure as well as the generation of ROS and NO in the Col-0 guard
      cells. However, the production of ROS and NO and stomatal closure induced by HRW 
      were absent in the gpa1-4 mutant lacking the expression of AtGPA1. By contrast,
      overexpression of AtGPA1 in gpa1-4 (AtGPA1-HA/gpa1-4) restored stomatal closure
      and the generation of NO and ROS in the presence of HRW. Taken together, our
      results suggest that GPA1 is necessary for HRW-induced stomatal closure in
      Arabidopsis.

      drought tolerance to overexpressing Arabidopsis plants.

AB  - Adaptation of higher plants to extreme environmental conditions is under complex 
      regulation. Several small peptides have recently been described to modulate
      responses to stress conditions. The Small Paraquat resistance protein (SPQ) of
      Lepidium crassifolium has previously been identified due to its capacity to
      confer paraquat resistance to overexpressing transgenic Arabidopsis plants. Here,
      we show that overexpression of the closely related Arabidopsis SPQ can also
      enhance resistance to paraquat, while the Arabidopsis spq1 mutant is slightly
      hypersensitive to this herbicide. Besides being implicated in paraquat response, 
      overexpression of SPQs enhanced sensitivity to abscisic acid (ABA), and the
      knockout spq1 mutant was less sensitive to ABA. Both Lepidium- and
      Arabidopsis-derived SPQs could improve drought tolerance by reducing water loss, 
      stabilizing photosynthetic electron transport and enhancing plant viability and
      survival in a water-limited environment. Enhanced drought tolerance of
      SPQ-overexpressing plants could be confirmed by characterizing various parameters
      of growth, morphology and photosynthesis using an automatic plant phenotyping
      platform with RGB and chlorophyll fluorescence imaging. Our results suggest that 
      SPQs can be regulatory small proteins connecting ROS and ABA regulation and
      through that influence responses to certain stresses.

TI  - Natural herbicidal alkaloid berberine regulates the expression of thalianol and
      marneral gene clusters in Arabidopsis thaliana.
PG  - 2896-2908
LID - 10.1002/ps.6914 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Berberine is a plant-derived herbicidal alkaloid. The herbicidal
      mechanism of berberine is still not clear. In this study, our aim is to clarify
      the mechanism of berberine inhibiting the root growth of Arabidopsis thaliana,
      aiming at providing new insight into identifying the molecular targets of
      berberine. RESULTS: The whole-genome RNA sequencing had revealed that 403 genes
      were down-regulated, and 422 genes were up-regulated in Arabidopsis roots with
      berberine treatment. According to KEGG and GO analysis, the expression of two
      genes AT5G48010 (Thas) and AT5G42600 (MRN1) which are in the sesquiterpenoid and 
      triterpenoid biosynthesis pathway were affected most. These two genes belong to
      thalianol and marneral gene clusters. RT-PCR showed that Arabidopsis responds to 
      berberine by inhibiting root growth through repressing the expression of
      thalianol and marneral gene clusters, which was independent of the upstream
      effectors ARP6 and HTA9-1. GC-MS analysis showed that berberine could inhibit
      THAH in the biosynthetic network of triterpenoid gene cluster in Arabidopsis and 
      thus cause the accumulation of thalianol. CONCLUSION: Our study indicated the
      repression of the thalianol and marneral gene clusters as the primary mechanism
      of action of berberine in Arabidopsis, which may result in plant growth defects
      by interrupting the thalianol metabolic pathway. This provides novel clues as to 
      the possible molecular herbicidal mechanism of berberine. (c) 2022 Society of

AB  - Chloroplasts serve as cold priming hubs modulating the transcriptional response
      of Arabidopsis thaliana to a second cold stimulus for several days by postcold
      accumulation of thylakoid ascorbate peroxidases (tAPX). In an attempt to
      investigate cross-priming effects of cold on plant pathogen protection, we show
      here that such a single 24-h cold treatment at 4 degrees C decreased the
      susceptibility of Arabidopsis to virulent Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 
      but did not alter resistance against the avirulent P. syringae pv. tomato avRPM1 
      and P. syringae pv. tomato avrRPS4 strains or the effector-deficient P. syringae 
      pv. tomato strain hrcC(-). The effect of cold priming against P. syringae pv.
      tomato was active immediately after cold exposure and memorized for at least 5
      days. The priming benefit was established independent of the immune regulator
      Enhanced Disease Susceptibility 1 (EDS1) or activation of the immune-related
      genes NHL10, FRK1, ICS1 and PR1 but required thylakoid-bound as well as stromal
      ascorbate peroxidase activities because the effect was absent or weak in
      corresponding knock-out-lines. Suppression of tAPX postcold regulation in a
      conditional-inducible tAPX-RNAi line led to increased bacterial growth numbers.
      This highlights that the plant immune system benefits from postcold regeneration 
      of the protective chloroplast peroxidase system.[Formula: see text] Copyright (c)

      virus-induced gene silencing in Arabidopsis thaliana.

AB  - Through the inactivation of genes that act during meiosis it is possible to
      direct the genetic make-up of plants in subsequent generations and optimize
      breeding schemes. Offspring may show higher recombination of parental alleles
      resulting from elevated crossover (CO) incidence, or by omission of meiotic
      divisions, offspring may become polyploid. However, stable mutations in genes
      essential for recombination, or for either one of the two meiotic divisions, can 
      have pleiotropic effects on plant morphology and line stability, for instance by 
      causing lower fertility. Therefore, it is often favorable to temporarily change
      gene expression during meiosis rather than relying on stable null mutants. It was
      previously shown that virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) can be used to
      transiently reduce CO frequencies. We asked if VIGS could also be used to modify 
      other processes throughout meiosis and during pollen formation in Arabidopsis
      thaliana. Here, we show that VIGS-mediated knock-down of FIGL1, RECQ4A/B, OSD1
      and QRT2 can induce (i) an increase in chiasma numbers, (ii) unreduced gametes
      and (iii) pollen tetrads. We further show that VIGS can target both sexes and
      different genetic backgrounds and can simultaneously silence different gene
      copies. The successful knock-down of these genes in A. thaliana suggests that
      VIGS can be exploited to manipulate any process during or shortly after meiosis. 
      Hence, the transient induction of changes in inheritance patterns can be used as 
      a powerful tool for applied research and biotechnological applications.

AB  - Sensing carbohydrate availability is essential for plants to coordinate their
      growth and development. In Arabidopsis thaliana, TREHALOSE 6-PHOSPHATE SYNTHASE 1
      (TPS1) and its product, trehalose 6-phosphate (T6P), are important for the
      metabolic control of development. tps1 mutants are embryo-lethal and unable to
      flower when embryogenesis is rescued. T6P regulates development in part through
      inhibition of SUCROSE NON-FERMENTING1 RELATED KINASE1 (SnRK1). Here, we explored 
      the role of SnRK1 in T6P-mediated plant growth and development using a
      combination of a mutant suppressor screen and genetic, cellular and
      transcriptomic approaches. We report nonsynonymous amino acid substitutions in
      the catalytic KIN10 and regulatory SNF4 subunits of SnRK1 that can restore both
      embryogenesis and flowering of tps1 mutant plants. The identified SNF4 point
      mutations disrupt the interaction with the catalytic subunit KIN10. Contrary to
      the common view that the two A. thaliana SnRK1 catalytic subunits act
      redundantly, we found that loss-of-function mutations in KIN11 are unable to
      restore embryogenesis and flowering, highlighting the important role of KIN10 in 
      T6P signalling.

TI  - Ethylene Plays a Dual Role during Infection by Plasmodiophora brassicae of
      Arabidopsis thaliana.
LID - 1299 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/genes13081299 [doi]
AB  - Plasmodiophora brassicae infection leads to hypertrophy of host roots and
      subsequent formation of galls, causing huge economic losses to agricultural
      producers of Cruciferae plants. Ethylene (ET) has been reported to play a vital
      role against necrotrophic pathogens in the classic immunity system. More clues
      suggested that the defense to pathogens in roots may be different from the
      acrial. The ET pathway may play a positive role in the infection of P. brassicae,
      as shown by recent transcriptome profiling. However, the molecular basis of ET
      remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the potential role of
      ethylene against P. brassicae infection in an ein3/eil1 double-mutant of
      Arabidopsis thaliana (A. thaliana). After infection, ein3/eil1 (Disease Index/DI:
      93) showed more susceptibility compared with wild type (DI: 75). Then, we
      inoculated A. thaliana Columbia-0 (Col-0) with P. brassicae by
      1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) and pyrazinamide (PZA), respectively.
      It was found that the symptoms of infected roots with ACC were more serious than 
      those with PZA at 20 dpi (day post infection). However, the DI were almost the
      same in different treatments at 30 dpi. WRKY75 can be directly regulated by ET
      and was upregulated at 7 dpi with ACC, as shown by qRT-PCR. The wrky75-c mutant
      of A. thaliana (DI: 93.75) was more susceptible than the wild type in
      Arabidopsis. Thus, our work reveals the dual roles of ET in infection of P.
      brassicae and provides evidence of ET in root defense against pathogens.

TI  - PHR1 positively regulates phosphate starvation-induced anthocyanin accumulation
      through direct upregulation of genes F3'H and LDOX in Arabidopsis.
PG  - 42
LID - 10.1007/s00425-022-03952-w [doi]
AB  - MAIN CONCLUSION: Phosphate deficiency promotes anthocyanin accumulation in
      Arabidopsis through direct binding of PHR1 to the P1BS motifs on the promoters of
      F3'H and LDOX and thereby upregulating their expression. Phosphorus is one of the
      essential elements for plants, and plants mainly absorb inorganic phosphate (Pi) 
      from soil. But Pi deficiency is a common factor limiting plant growth and
      development. Anthocyanin accumulation in green tissues (such as leaves) is one of
      the characteristics of many plants in response to Pi starvation. However, little 
      is known about the mechanism by which Pi starvation induces anthocyanin
      accumulation. Here, we found that the mutation of the gene PHOSPHATE STARVATION
      RESPONSE1 (PHR1), which encodes a key factor involved in Pi starvation signaling 
      in Arabidopsis, significantly attenuates anthocyanin accumulation under
      Pi-limiting conditions. Moreover, the expression of several Pi
      deficiency-upregulated genes that are involved in anthocyanin biosyntheses, such 
      as flavanone 3'-hydroxylase (F3'H), dihydroflavonol 4-reductase (DFR),
      leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase (LDOX), and production of anthocyanin pigment 1
      (PAP1), was significantly lower in the phr1-1 mutant than in the wild type (WT). 
      Both yeast one-hybrid (Y1H) analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation
      quantitative PCR (ChIP-qPCR) showed that PHR1 can interact with the promoters of 
      F3'H and LDOX, but not DFR and PAP1. By electrophoretic mobility shift assay
      (EMSA), it was further confirmed that the PHR1-binding sequence (P1BS) motifs
      located on the F3'H and LDOX promoters are required for the PHR1 bindings. Also, 
      in Arabidopsis protoplasts, PHR1 enhanced the transcriptional activity of the
      F3'H and LDOX promoters, but these effects were markedly impaired when the P1BS
      motifs were mutated. Taken together, these results indicate that PHR1 positively 
      regulates Pi starvation-induced anthocyanin accumulation in Arabidopsis, at least
      in part, by directly binding the P1BS motifs located on the promoters to
      upregulate the transcription of anthocyanin biosynthetic genes F3'H and LDOX.

AB  - Histone deacetylases (HDACs) play important roles in the repression of gene
      expression. Our previous study revealed that HISTONE DEACETYLASE 9 (HDA9)
      interacts with ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL 5 (HY5) and is involved in regulating plant
      autophagy in response to the light-to-dark transition and nitrogen starvation. In
      this study, we observed that the hda9-1 and hy5-215 single mutants flowered
      earlier compared with the wild-type Col-0; in addition, the hda9-1 hy5-215 double
      mutant flowered earlier than each single mutant. The expression of several
      positive flowering time genes was upregulated in the hda9-1, hy5-215, and hda9-1 
      hy5-215 mutants. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated that HDA9
      and HY5 bound directly to the promoter regions of PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR 
      4 (PIF4) and CONSTANS-LIKE 5 (COL5) and repressed their expression through H3K9
      and H3K27 deacetylation. Taken together, our results reveal the epigenetic
      mechanism explaining how the HDA9-HY5 module functions in controlling flowering
      time.

TI  - MicroRNA172 controls inflorescence meristem size through regulation of APETALA2
      in Arabidopsis.
PG  - 356-371
LID - 10.1111/nph.18111 [doi]
AB  - The APETALA2 (AP2) transcription factor regulates flower development, floral
      transition and shoot apical meristem (SAM) maintenance in Arabidopsis. AP2 is
      also regulated at the post-transcriptional level by microRNA172 (miR172), but the
      contribution of this to SAM maintenance is poorly understood. We generated
      transgenic plants carrying a form of AP2 that is resistant to miR172 (rAP2) or
      carrying a wild-type AP2 susceptible to miR172. Phenotypic and genetic analyses
      were performed on these lines and mir172 mutants to study the role of AP2
      regulation by miR172 on meristem size and the rate of flower production. We found
      that rAP2 enlarges the inflorescence meristem by increasing cell size and cell
      number. Misexpression of rAP2 from heterologous promoters showed that AP2 acts in
      the central zone (CZ) and organizing center (OC) to increase SAM size.
      Furthermore, we found that AP2 is negatively regulated by AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR 3
      (ARF3). However, genetic analyses indicated that ARF3 also influences SAM size
      and flower production rate independently of AP2. The study identifies miR172/AP2 
      as a regulatory module controlling inflorescence meristem size and suggests that 
      transcriptional regulation of AP2 by ARF3 fine-tunes SAM size determination.

TI  - Overexpression of Oil Palm Early Nodulin 93 Protein Gene (EgENOD93) Enhances In
      Vitro Shoot Regeneration in Arabidopsis thaliana.
PG  - 743-757
LID - 10.1007/s12033-022-00450-y [doi]
AB  - EgENOD93 was first identified in a cDNA microarray study of oil palm tissue
      culture where it was highly expressed in leaf explants with embryogenic
      potential. Functional characterization via an RNA interference study of its
      orthologue in Medicago truncatula demonstrated a significant role of this gene in
      somatic embryo formation. In this study, EgENOD93 was overexpressed in the
      important model plant Arabidopsis thaliana to investigate the embryogenic
      potential of EgENOD93 transgenic Arabidopsis explants compared to explants from
      control plants (pMDC140 and WT). Experiments using leaf explants revealed higher 
      numbers of regenerated shoots at day 27 in all the homozygous transgenic
      Arabidopsis cultures (Tg01, Tg02 and Tg03) compared to controls. The expression
      level of EgENOD93 in Arabidopsis cultures was quantified using reverse
      transcription quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR). The results supported the
      overexpression of this gene in transgenic Arabidopsis cultures, with 6 and 10
      times higher expression of EgENOD93 in callus at Day 9 and Day 20, respectively. 
      Overall, the results support the role of EgENOD93 in the enhancement of shoot
      regeneration in transgenic Arabidopsis. This together with the previous results
      observed in oil palm and Medicago truncatula suggests that ENOD93 plays a key
      role in the induction of somatic embryogenesis. A similarity to early
      nodulation-like ontogeny is possible.

TI  - The Mechanosensitive Ion Channel MSL10 Modulates Susceptibility to Pseudomonas
      syringae in Arabidopsis thaliana.
PG  - 567-582
LID - 10.1094/MPMI-08-21-0207-FI [doi]
AB  - Plants sense and respond to molecular signals associated with the presence of
      pathogens and their virulence factors. Mechanical signals generated during
      pathogenic invasion may also be important, but their contributions have rarely
      been studied. Here, we investigate the potential role of a mechanosensitive ion
      channel, MscS-like (MSL)10, in defense against the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas
      syringae in Arabidopsis thaliana. We previously showed that overexpression of
      MSL10-GFP, phospho-mimetic versions of MSL10, and the gain-of-function allele
      msl10-3G all produce dwarfing, spontaneous cell death, and the hyperaccumulation 
      of reactive oxygen species. These phenotypes are shared by many autoimmune
      mutants and are frequently suppressed by growth at high temperature in those
      lines. We found that the same was true for all three MSL10 hypermorphs. In
      addition, we show that the SGT1/RAR1/HSP90 cochaperone complex was required for
      dwarfing and ectopic cell death, PAD4 and SID2 were partially required, and the
      immune regulators EDS1 and NDR1 were dispensable. All MSL10 hypermorphs exhibited
      reduced susceptibility to infection by P. syringae strain Pto DC3000 and Pto
      DC3000 expressing the avirulence genes avrRpt2 or avrRpm1 but not Pto DC3000 hrpL
      and showed an accelerated induction of PR1 expression compared with wild-type
      plants. Null msl10-1 mutants were delayed in PR1 induction and displayed modest
      susceptibility to infection by coronatine-deficient P. syringae pv. tomato.
      Finally, stomatal closure was reduced in msl10-1 loss-of-function mutants in
      response to P. syringae pv. tomato COR(-). These data show that MSL10 modulates
      pathogen responses and begin to address the possibility that mechanical signals
      are exploited by the plant for pathogen perception.[Formula: see text] Copyright

AB  - Protein transport to peroxisomes requires various proteins, such as receptors in 
      the cytosol and components of the transport machinery on peroxisomal membranes.
      The Arabidopsis apem (aberrant peroxisome morphology) mutant apem7 shows
      decreased efficiency of peroxisome targeting signal 1-dependent protein transport
      to peroxisomes. In apem7 mutants, peroxisome targeting signal 2-dependent protein
      transport is also disturbed, and plant growth is repressed. The APEM7 gene
      encodes a protein homologous to peroxin 4 (PEX4), which belongs to the
      ubiquitin-conjugating (UBC) protein family; however, the UBC activity of
      Arabidopsis PEX4 remains to be investigated. Here, we show using electron
      microscopy and immunoblot analysis using specific PEX4 antibodies and in vitro
      transcription/translation assay that PEX4 localizes to peroxisomal membranes and 
      possesses UBC activity. We found that the substitution of proline with leucine by
      apem7 mutation alters ubiquitination of PEX4. Furthermore, substitution of the
      active-site cysteine residue at position 90 in PEX4, which was predicted to be a 
      ubiquitin-conjugation site, with alanine did not restore the apem7 phenotype.
      Taken together, these findings indicate that abnormal ubiquitination in the apem7
      mutant alters ubiquitin signaling during the process of protein transport,
      suggesting that the UBC activity of PEX4 is indispensable for efficient protein
      transport to peroxisomes.

PG  - 1375-1388

AB  - KEY MESSAGE: miR394 regulates Arabidopsis flowering time in a LCR-independent
      manner. Arabidopsis plants harboring mutations in theMIR394 genes exhibit early
      flowering, lower expression of floral repressor FLC and higher expression of
      floral integrators FT and SOC1. Plant development occurs throughout its entire
      life cycle and involves a phase transition between vegetative and reproductive
      phases, leading to the flowering process, fruit formation and ultimately seed
      production. It has been shown that the microRNA394 (miR394) regulates the
      accumulation of the transcript coding for LEAF CURLING RESPONSIVENESS, a member
      of a family of F-Box proteins. The miR394 pathway regulates several processes
      including leaf morphology and development of the shoot apical meristem during
      embryogenesis, as well as having been assigned a role in the response to biotic
      and abiotic stress in Arabidopsis thaliana and other species. Here, we
      characterized plants harboring mutations in MIR394 precursor genes and
      demonstrate that mir394a mir394b double mutants display an early flowering
      phenotype which correlates with a lower expression of FLOWERING LOCUS C earlier
      in development and higher expression of the floral integrators FLOWERING LOCUS T 
      and SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS 1. Consequently, mutant plants
      produce fewer branches and exhibit lower seed production. Our work reveals
      previously unknown developmental aspects regulated by the miR394 pathway, in an
      LCR-independent manner, contributing to the characterization of the multiple
      roles of this versatile plant regulatory miRNA.

TI  - Root system size and root hair length are key phenes for nitrate acquisition and 
      biomass production across natural variation in Arabidopsis.
PG  - 3569-3583
LID - 10.1093/jxb/erac118 [doi]
AB  - The role of root phenes in nitrogen (N) acquisition and biomass production was
      evaluated in 10 contrasting natural accessions of Arabidopsis thaliana L.
      Seedlings were grown on vertical agar plates with two different nitrate supplies.
      The low N treatment increased the root to shoot biomass ratio and promoted the
      proliferation of lateral roots and root hairs. The cost of a larger root system
      did not impact shoot biomass. Greater biomass production could be achieved
      through increased root length or through specific root hair characteristics. A
      greater number of root hairs may provide a low-resistance pathway under elevated 
      N conditions, while root hair length may enhance root zone exploration under low 
      N conditions. The variability of N uptake and the expression levels of genes
      encoding nitrate transporters were measured. A positive correlation was found
      between root system size and high-affinity nitrate uptake, emphasizing the
      benefits of an exploratory root organ in N acquisition. The expression levels of 
      NRT1.2/NPF4.6, NRT2.2, and NRT1.5/NPF7.3 negatively correlated with some root
      morphological traits. Such basic knowledge in Arabidopsis demonstrates the
      importance of root phenes to improve N acquisition and paves the way to design
      eudicot ideotypes.

TI  - Nitrogen deficiency- and sucrose-induced anthocyanin biosynthesis is modulated by
      HISTONE DEACETYLASE15 in Arabidopsis.
PG  - 3726-3742
LID - 10.1093/jxb/erac067 [doi]
AB  - Anthocyanin accumulation is a hallmark response to nitrogen (N) deficiency in
      Arabidopsis. Although the regulation of anthocyanin biosynthesis has been
      extensively studied, the roles of chromatin modification in this process are
      largely unknown. In this study we show that anthocyanin accumulation induced by N
      deficiency is modulated by HISTONE DEACETYLASE15 (HDA15) in Arabidopsis
      seedlings. The hda15-1 T-DNA insertion mutant accumulated more anthocyanins than 
      the wild-type when the N supply was limited, and this was caused by up-regulation
      of anthocyanin biosynthetic and regulatory genes in the mutant. The up-regulated 
      genes also had increased levels of histone acetylation in the mutant. The
      accumulation of anthocyanins induced by sucrose and methyl jasmonate, but not
      that induced by H2O2 and phosphate starvation, was also greater in the hda15-1
      mutant. While sucrose increased histone acetylation in the hda15-1 mutant in
      genes in a similar manner to that caused by N deficiency, methyl jasmonate only
      enhanced histone acetylation in the genes involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis.
      Our results suggest that different stresses act through distinct regulatory
      modules to activate anthocyanin biosynthesis, and that HDA15-mediated histone
      modification modulates the expression of anthocyanin biosynthetic and regulatory 
      genes to avoid overaccumulation in response to N deficiency and other stresses.

TI  - DNA Methyltransferase 3 (MET3) is regulated by Polycomb group complex during
      Arabidopsis endosperm development.
PG  - 141-151
LID - 10.1007/s00497-021-00436-x [doi]
AB  - Complex epigenetic changes occur during plant reproduction. These regulations
      ensure the proper transmission of epigenetic information as well as allowing for 
      zygotic totipotency. In Arabidopsis, the main DNA methyltransferase is called
      MET1 and is responsible for methylating cytosine in the CG context. The
      Arabidopsis genome encodes for three additional reproduction-specific homologs of
      MET1, namely MET2a, MET2b and MET3. In this paper, we show that the DNA
      methyltransferase MET3 is expressed in the seed endosperm and its expression is
      later restricted to the chalazal endosperm. MET3 is biallelically expressed in
      the endosperm but displays a paternal expression bias. We found that MET3
      expression is regulated by the Polycomb complex proteins FIE and MSI1. Seed
      development is not impaired in met3 mutant, and we could not observe significant 
      transcriptional changes in met3 mutant. MET3 might regulates gene expression in a
      Polycomb mutant background suggesting a further complexification of the interplay
      between H3K27me3 and DNA methylation in the seed endosperm. KEY MESSAGE: The DNA 
      METHYLTRANSFERASE MET3 is controlled by Polycomb group complex during endosperm
      development.

TI  - Arabidopsis Toxicos en Levadura 12 Modulates Salt Stress and ABA Responses in
      Arabidopsis thaliana.
LID - 7290 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23137290 [doi]
AB  - Salt is one of the most common abiotic stresses, causing ionic and osmotic
      pressure changes that affect plant growth and development. In this work, we
      present molecular and genetic evidence that Arabidopsis Toxicos en Levadura 12
      (ATL12) is involved in both salt stress and in the abscisic acid response to this
      stress. We demonstrate that ATL12 is highly induced in response to salt stress
      and that atl12 mutants have a lower germination rate, decreased root length, and 
      lower survival rate compared to the Col-0 wild-type in response to salt stress.
      Overexpression of ATL12 increases expression of the salt stress-associated genes 
      SOS1/2, and ABA-responsive gene RD29B. Additionally, higher levels of reactive
      oxygen species are detected when ATL12 is overexpressed, and qRT-PCR showed that 
      ATL12 is involved in the AtRBOHD/F-mediated signaling. ATL12 expression is also
      highly induced by ABA treatment. Mutants of atl12 are hypersensitive to ABA and
      have a shorter root length. A decrease in water loss and reduced stomatal
      aperture were also observed in atl12 mutants in response to ABA. ABA-responsive
      genes RD29B and RAB18 were downregulated in atl12 mutants but were upregulated in
      the overexpression line of ATL12 in response to ABA. Taken together our results
      suggest that ATL12 modulates the response to salt stress and is involved in the
      ABA signaling pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana.

TI  - Dynamics of Protein Phosphorylation during Arabidopsis Seed Germination.
LID - 7059 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23137059 [doi]
AB  - Seed germination is critical for early plantlet development and is tightly
      controlled by environmental factors. Nevertheless, the signaling networks
      underlying germination control remain elusive. In this study, the remodeling of
      Arabidopsis seed phosphoproteome during imbibition was investigated using stable 
      isotope dimethyl labeling and nanoLC-MS/MS analysis. Freshly harvested seeds were
      imbibed under dark or constant light to restrict or promote germination,
      respectively. For each light regime, phosphoproteins were extracted and
      identified from dry and imbibed (6 h, 16 h, and 24 h) seeds. A large repertoire
      of 10,244 phosphopeptides from 2546 phosphoproteins, including 110 protein
      kinases and key regulators of seed germination such as Delay Of Germination 1
      (DOG1), was established. Most phosphoproteins were only identified in dry seeds. 
      Early imbibition led to a similar massive downregulation in dormant and
      non-dormant seeds. After 24 h, 411 phosphoproteins were specifically identified
      in non-dormant seeds. Gene ontology analyses revealed their involvement in RNA
      and protein metabolism, transport, and signaling. In addition, 489
      phosphopeptides were quantified, and 234 exhibited up or downregulation during
      imbibition. Interaction networks and motif analyses revealed their association
      with potential signaling modules involved in germination control. Our study
      provides evidence of a major role of phosphosignaling in the regulation of
      Arabidopsis seed germination.

AB  - The ddc mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana is characterized by pleiotropic phenotypic
      alterations including a curl-shaped leaf, previously explained by disturbed auxin
      metabolism and transport. The present study was aimed at further explore the
      molecular bases underlying the abnormal phenotype of the ddc leaf. We
      demonstrated that genes specifically related to leaf fate commitment and
      morphogenesis were misexpressed on developing ddc leaves, such as upregulation of
      CURLY LEAF (CLF) and downregulation of ASYMMETRIC LEAVES2 (AS2), KNOTTED-like
      gene from A. thaliana (KNAT6), TEOSINTE-LIKE1 CYCLOIDEA and PROLIFERATING CELL
      FACTOR 2 (TCP2) and others. The CLF gene, encoding a component of Polycomb
      repressive complex 2 (PRC2) which adds trimethylation marks at Lys27 of histone
      H3, was overexpressed in the ddc mutant and concomitantly was correlated with DNA
      methylation-dependent repression of its negative regulator UCL1. KNAT6, encoding 
      a class 1 KNOX homeotic gene, had increased H3K27me3 trimethylation levels,
      suggesting it is a target gene of the CLF containing PRC2 complex in the ddc
      mutant. We postulate that different epigenetic mechanisms modulate expression of 
      genes related to auxin pathways as well as gene targets of Polycomb repressive
      action, during leaf morphogenesis.

AB  - Histone methylation plays a central role in regulating chromatin state and gene
      expression in Arabidopsis and is involved in a variety of physiological and
      developmental processes. Dynamic regulation of histone methylation relies on both
      histone methyltransferase "writer" and histone demethylases "eraser" proteins. In
      this review, we focus on the four major histone methylation modifications in
      Arabidopsis H3, H3K4, H3K9, H3K27, and H3K36, and summarize current knowledge of 
      the dynamic regulation of these modifications, with an emphasis on the
      biochemical and structural perspectives of histone methyltransferases and
      demethylases.

TI  - Histone deacetylase AtSRT2 regulates salt tolerance during seed germination via
      repression of vesicle-associated membrane protein 714 (VAMP714) in Arabidopsis.
PG  - 1278-1293
LID - 10.1111/nph.18060 [doi]
AB  - Salt tolerance during seed germination is essential for seedling establishment
      under salt stress. Sirtuin-like proteins, NAD(+) -dependent histone deacetylases,
      are involved in plant responses to abiotic stresses; however, the regulatory
      mechanism remains unknown. We elucidated the mechanism underlying AtSRT2 (a
      sirtuin-like protein)-mediated regulation of salt tolerance during seed
      germination in Arabidopsis. The AtSRT2 mutant srt2 exhibited significantly
      reduced seed germination percentages under salt stress; its targets were
      identified via chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with ultra-high-throughput
      parallel DNA sequencing (ChIP-Seq) assay. Epistasis analysis was performed to
      identify AtSRT2-related pathways. Overexpression of SRT2.7, an AtSRT2 splice
      variant, rescued the salt-sensitive phenotype of mutant srt2. AtSRT2 histone
      deacetylation activity was important for salt tolerance during seed germination. 
      The acetylation level of histone H4K8 locus in srt2-1 increased significantly
      under salt treatment. Vesicle-associated membrane protein 714 (VAMP714), a
      negative regulator of hydrogen peroxide (H2 O2 )-containing vesicle trafficking
      in cells, was identified as a target of AtSRT2. AtSRT2 regulated histone
      acetylation in the promoter region of VAMP714 and inhibited VAMP714 transcription
      under salt treatment. Seed germination percentage of double-mutant srt2-1vamp714 
      was close to that of single-mutant vamp714, and higher than that of single-mutant
      srt2 under salt stress. Hydrogen peroxide content and DNA damage increased after 
      salt treatment in srt2 during seed germination. AtSRT2 regulates salt tolerance
      during seed germination through VAMP714 in Arabidopsis.

TI  - Warm Temperature Promotes Shoot Regeneration in Arabidopsis thaliana.
PG  - 618-634
LID - 10.1093/pcp/pcac017 [doi]
AB  - Many plants are able to regenerate upon cutting, and this process can be enhanced
      in vitro by incubating explants on hormone-supplemented media. While such
      protocols have been used for decades, little is known about the molecular details
      of how incubation conditions influence their efficiency. In this study, we find
      that warm temperature promotes both callus formation and shoot regeneration in
      Arabidopsis thaliana. We show that such an increase in shoot regenerative
      capacity at higher temperatures correlates with the enhanced expression of
      several regeneration-associated genes, such as CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON 1 (CUC1)
      encoding a transcription factor involved in shoot meristem formation and YUCCAs
      (YUCs) encoding auxin biosynthesis enzymes. ChIP-sequencing analyses further
      reveal that histone variant H2A.Z is enriched on these loci at 17 degrees C,
      while its occupancy is reduced by an increase in ambient temperature to 27
      degrees C. Moreover, we provide genetic evidence to demonstrate that H2A.Z acts
      as a repressor of de novo shoot organogenesis since H2A.Z-depleted mutants
      display enhanced shoot regeneration. This study thus uncovers a new
      chromatin-based mechanism that influences hormone-induced regeneration and
      additionally highlights incubation temperature as a key parameter for optimizing 
      in vitro tissue culture.

TI  - TCP15 interacts with GOLDEN2-LIKE 1 to control cotyledon opening in Arabidopsis.
PG  - 748-763
LID - 10.1111/tpj.15701 [doi]
AB  - After germination, exposure to light promotes the opening and expansion of the
      cotyledons and the development of the photosynthetic apparatus in a process
      called de-etiolation. This process is crucial for seedling establishment and
      photoautotrophic growth. TEOSINTE BRANCHED 1, CYCLOIDEA, and PROLIFERATING CELL
      FACTORS (TCP) transcription factors are important developmental regulators of
      plant responses to internal and external signals that are grouped into two main
      classes. In this study, we identified GOLDEN2-LIKE 1 (GLK1), a key
      transcriptional regulator of photomorphogenesis, as a protein partner of class I 
      TCPs during light-induced cotyledon opening and expansion in Arabidopsis. The
      class I TCP TCP15 and GLK1 are mutually required for cotyledon opening and the
      induction of SAUR and EXPANSIN genes, involved in cell expansion. TCP15 also
      participates in the expression of photosynthesis-associated genes regulated by
      GLK1, like LHCB1.4 and LHCB2.2. Furthermore, GLK1 and TCP15 bind to the same
      promoter regions of different target genes containing either GLK or TCP binding
      motifs and binding of TCP15 is affected in a GLK1-deficient background,
      suggesting that a complex between TCP15 and GLK1 participates in the induction of
      these genes. We postulate that GLK1 helps to recruit TCP15 for the modulation of 
      cell expansion genes in cotyledons and that the functional interaction between
      these transcription factors may serve to coordinate the expression of cell
      expansion genes with that of genes involved in the development of the
      photosynthetic apparatus.

TI  - AtFTCD-L, a trans-Golgi network localized protein, modulates root growth of
      Arabidopsis in high-concentration agar culture medium.
PG  - 3
LID - 10.1007/s00425-022-03911-5 [doi]
AB  - MAIN CONCLUSION: AtFTCD-L protein is localized on the TGN vesicles in Arabidopsis
      root cap cells. AtFTCD-L mutation resulted in slow root growth of Arabidopsis in 
      high-concentration agar culture medium. Arabidopsis formiminotransferase
      cyclodeaminase-like protein (AtFTCD-L) in Arabidopsis is homologous to the
      formiminotransferase cyclodeaminase (FTCD) protein in animal cells. However, the 
      localization and function of AtFTCD-L remain unknown in Arabidopsis. In this
      study, we generated and analyzed a deletion mutant of AtFTCD-L with a T-DNA
      insertion. We found that the growth of Arabidopsis roots with the T-DNA insertion
      mutation in AtFTCD-L was slower than that of wild-type roots when grown in
      high-concentration 1/2 MS agar culture medium. AtFTCD-L-GFP could restore the
      ftcd-l mutant phenotype. In addition, the AtFTCD-L protein was localized on the
      trans-Golgi network (TGN) vesicles in Arabidopsis root cap cells. Fluorescence
      recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiment using Arabidopsis pollen-specific
      receptor-like kinase-GFP (AtPRK1-GFP) stably transformed plants showed that the
      deficiency of AtFTCD-L protein in Arabidopsis led to slower secretion in the root
      cap peripheral cells. The AtFTCD-L protein deficiency also resulted in a
      significantly reduced monosaccharides content in the culture medium. Based on the
      above results, we speculate that the AtFTCD-L protein may be involved in sorting 
      and/or transportation of TGN vesicles in root cap peripheral cells, thereby
      regulating the extracellular secretion of mucilage components in the root cap.

TI  - AtERF71/HRE2, an Arabidopsis AP2/ERF Transcription Factor Gene, Contains Both
      Positive and Negative Cis-Regulatory Elements in Its Promoter Region Involved in 
      Hypoxia and Salt Stress Responses.
LID - 5310 [pii]

AB  - In the signal transduction network, from the perception of stress signals to
      stress-responsive gene expression, various transcription factors and
      cis-regulatory elements in stress-responsive promoters coordinate plant
      adaptation to abiotic stresses. Among the AP2/ERF transcription factor family,
      group VII ERF (ERF-VII) genes, such as RAP2.12, RAP2.2, RAP2.3, AtERF73/HRE1, and
      AtERF71/HRE2, are known to be involved in the response to hypoxia in Arabidopsis.
      Notably, HRE2 has been reported to be involved in responses to hypoxia and
      osmotic stress. In this study, we dissected HRE2 promoter to identify hypoxia-
      and salt stress-responsive region(s). The analysis of the promoter deletion
      series of HRE2 using firefly luciferase and GUS as reporter genes indicated that 
      the -116 to -2 region is responsible for both hypoxia and salt stress responses. 
      Using yeast one-hybrid screening, we isolated HAT22/ABIG1, a member of the HD-Zip
      II subfamily, which binds to the -116 to -2 region of HRE2 promoter.
      Interestingly, HAT22/ABIG1 repressed the transcription of HRE2 via the EAR motif 
      located in the N-terminal region of HAT22/ABIG1. HAT22/ABIG1 bound to the
      5'-AATGATA-3' sequence, HD-Zip II-binding-like cis-regulatory element, in the
      -116 to -2 region of HRE2 promoter. Our findings demonstrate that the -116 to -2 
      region of HRE2 promoter contains both positive and negative cis-regulatory
      elements, which may regulate the expression of HRE2 in responses to hypoxia and
      salt stress and that HAT22/ABIG1 negatively regulates HRE2 transcription by
      binding to the HD-Zip II-binding-like element in the promoter region.

TI  - Genetic Dissection of Light-Regulated Adventitious Root Induction in Arabidopsis 
      thaliana Hypocotyls.
LID - 5301 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23105301 [doi]
AB  - Photomorphogenic responses of etiolated seedlings include the inhibition of
      hypocotyl elongation and opening of the apical hook. In addition, dark-grown
      seedlings respond to light by the formation of adventitious roots (AR) on the
      hypocotyl. How light signaling controls adventitious rooting is less well
      understood. Hereto, we analyzed adventitious rooting under different light
      conditions in wild type and photomorphogenesis mutants in Arabidopsis thaliana.
      Etiolation was not essential for AR formation but raised the competence to form
      AR under white and blue light. The blue light receptors CRY1 and PHOT1/PHOT2 are 
      key elements contributing to the induction of AR formation in response to light. 
      Furthermore, etiolation-controlled competence for AR formation depended on the
      COP9 signalosome, E3 ubiquitin ligase CONSTITUTIVELY PHOTOMORPHOGENIC (COP1), the
      COP1 interacting SUPPRESSOR OF PHYA-105 (SPA) kinase family members (SPA1,2 and
      3) and Phytochrome-Interacting Factors (PIF). In contrast, ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5
      (HY5), suppressed AR formation. These findings provide a genetic framework that
      explains the high and low AR competence of Arabidopsis thaliana hypocotyls that
      were treated with dark, and light, respectively. We propose that light-induced
      auxin signal dissipation generates a transient auxin maximum that explains AR
      induction by a dark to light switch.

TI  - Hydrogen Sulfide Alleviates Manganese Stress in Arabidopsis.
LID - 5046 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23095046 [doi]
AB  - Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) has been shown to participate in various stress responses 
      in plants, including drought, salinity, extreme temperatures, osmotic stress, and
      heavy metal stress. Manganese (Mn), as a necessary nutrient for plant growth,
      plays an important role in photosynthesis, growth, development, and enzymatic
      activation of plants. However, excessive Mn(2+) in the soil can critically affect
      plant growth, particularly in acidic soil. In this study, the model plant
      Arabidopsis thaliana was used to explore the mechanism of H2S participation and
      alleviation of Mn stress. First, using wild-type Arabidopsis with excessive
      Mn(2+) treatment, the following factors were increased: H2S content, the main H2S
      synthetase L-cysteine desulfhydrase enzyme (AtLCD) activity, and the expression
      level of the AtLCD gene. Further, using the wild-type, AtLCD deletion mutant
      (lcd) and overexpression lines (OE5 and OE32) as materials, the phenotype of
      Arabidopsis seedlings was observed by exogenous application of hydrogen sulfide
      donor sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS) and scavenger hypotaurine (HT) under excessive
      Mn(2+) treatment. The results showed that NaHS can significantly alleviate the
      stress caused by Mn(2+), whereas HT aggravates this stress. The lcd mutant is
      more sensitive to Mn stress than the wild type, and the overexpression lines are 
      more resistant. Moreover, the mechanism of H2S alleviating Mn stress was
      determined. The Mn(2+) content and the expression of the Mn transporter gene in
      the mutant were significantly higher than those of the wild-type and
      overexpression lines. The accumulation of reactive oxygen species was
      significantly reduced in NaHS-treated Arabidopsis seedlings and AtLCD
      overexpression lines, and the activities of various antioxidant enzymes (SOD,
      POD, CAT, APX) also significantly increased. In summary, H2S is involved in the
      response of Arabidopsis to Mn stress and may alleviate the inhibition of Mn
      stress on Arabidopsis seedling growth by reducing Mn(2+) content, reducing
      reactive oxygen species content, and enhancing antioxidant enzyme activity. This 
      study provides an important basis for further study of plant resistance to heavy 
      metal stress.

TI  - Fatty alcohol oxidase 3 (FAO3) and FAO4b connect the alcohol- and alkane-forming 
      pathways in Arabidopsis stem wax biosynthesis.
PG  - 3018-3029
LID - 10.1093/jxb/erab532 [doi]
AB  - The alcohol- and alkane-forming pathways in cuticular wax biosynthesis are well
      characterized in Arabidopsis. However, potential interactions between the two
      pathways remain unclear. Here, we reveal that mutation of CER4, the key gene in
      the alcohol-forming pathway, also led to a deficiency in the alkane-forming
      pathway in distal stems. To trace the connection between the two pathways, we
      characterized two homologs of fatty alcohol oxidase (FAO), FAO3 and FAO4b, which 
      were highly expressed in distal stems and localized to the endoplasmic reticulum.
      The amounts of waxes from the alkane-forming pathway were significantly decreased
      in stems of fao4b and much lower in fao3 fao4b plants, indicative of an
      overlapping function for the two proteins in wax synthesis. Additionally,
      overexpression of FAO3 and FAO4b in Arabidopsis resulted in a dramatic reduction 
      of primary alcohols and significant increases of aldehydes and related waxes.
      Moreover, expressing FAO3 or FAO4b led to significantly decreased amounts of
      C18-C26 alcohols in yeast co-expressing CER4 and FAR1. Collectively, these
      findings demonstrate that FAO3 and FAO4b are functionally redundant in
      suppressing accumulation of primary alcohols and contributing to aldehyde
      production, which provides a missing and long-sought-after link between these two
      pathways in wax biosynthesis.

AB  - Glutathione (GSH) plays a fundamental role in plant defense. Recent reports
      showed that enhanced GSH content activates mitogen-activated protein kinases
      (MPKs). However, the molecular mechanism behind this GSH-mediated MPKs expression
      during environmental challenges is unexplored. Here, we found that under control 
      and combined abiotic stress-treated conditions, GSH feeding activates MPK3
      expression in Arabidopsis thaliana by inducing its promoter, as established
      through the promoter activation assay. Additionally, transgenic A. thaliana
      overexpressing the LeMPK3 gene (AtMPK3 line) showed increased gamma-ECS
      expression, which was decreased in mpk3, the MPK3-depleted mutant. An in-gel
      kinase assay exhibited hyperphosphorylation of Myelin Basic Protein (MBP) in the 
      GSH-fed AtMPK3 transgenic line. Under control and combined abiotic stress treated
      conditions, expression of transcription factor WRKY40 binding to MPK3 promoter
      was up-regulated under enhanced GSH condition. Interestingly, GSH feeding was
      rendered ineffective in altering MPK3 expression in the Atwrky40 mutant,
      emphasizing the involvement of WRKY40 in GSH-MPK3 interplay. This was further
      confirmed by a wrky40 co-transformation assay. The immunoprecipitation assay
      followed by ChIP-qPCR showed a significant increase in the binding of WRKY40 to
      MPK3 promoter, which further established MPK3-WRKY40 association upon GSH
      feeding. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that GSH modulates MPK3
      expression via WRKY40 in response to stress.

TI  - Arabidopsis CPR5 plays a role in regulating nucleocytoplasmic transport of mRNAs 
      in ethylene signaling pathway.
PG  - 1075-1085
LID - 10.1007/s00299-022-02838-1 [doi]
AB  - KEY MESSAGE: Arabidopsis CPR5 is involved in regulation of ethylene signaling via
      two different ways: interacting with the ETR1 N-terminal domains, and controlling
      nucleocytoplasmic transport of ethylene-related mRNAs. The ETR1 receptor plays a 
      predominant role in ethylene signaling in Arabidopsis thaliana. Previous studies 
      showed that both RTE1 and CPR5 can directly bind to the ETR1 receptor and
      regulate ethylene signaling. RTE1 was suggested to promote the ETR1 receptor
      signaling by influencing its conformation, but little is known about the
      regulatory mechanism of CPR5 in ethylene signaling. In this study, we presented
      the data showing that both RTE1 and CPR5 bound to the N-terminal domains of ETR1,
      and regulated ethylene signaling via the ethylene receptor. On the other hand,
      the research provided evidence indicating that CPR5 could act as a nucleoporin to
      regulate the ethylene-related mRNAs export out of the nucleus, while RTE1 or its 
      homolog (RTH) had no effect on the nucleocytoplasmic transport of mRNAs. Nuclear 
      qRT-PCR analysis and poly(A)-mRNA in situ hybridization showed that defect of
      CPR5 restricted nucleocytoplasmic transport of mRNAs. These results advance our
      understanding of the regulatory mechanism of CPR5 in ethylene signaling.

TI  - Unpaired nucleotides on the stem of microRNA precursor are important for precise 
      cleavage by Dicer-like 1 in Arabidopsis.
PG  - 280-292
LID - 10.1111/gtc.12927 [doi]
AB  - Dicer-like 1 (DCL1) is a core component of the plant microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis 
      machinery. MiRNA is transcribed as a precursor RNA, termed primary miRNA
      (pri-miRNA), which is cleaved by DCL1 in two steps to generate miRNA/miRNA*
      duplex. Pri-miRNA is a single-stranded RNA that forms a hairpin structure with a 
      number of unpaired bases, hereafter called mismatches, on its stem. In the
      present study, by using purified recombinant Arabidopsis DCL1, we presented
      evidence that mismatches on the stem of pri-miRNA are important for precise DCL1 
      cleavage. We showed that a mismatch at the loop-distal side of the end of
      miRNA/miRNA* duplex is important for efficient cleavage of pri-miRNA in vitro, as
      previously suggested in planta. On the contrary, mismatches distant from the
      miRNA/miRNA* duplex region are important for determining the cleavage position by
      DCL1. The purified DCL1 proteins cleaved mutant pri-miRNA variants without such
      mismatches at a position at which wild-type pri-miRNA variants are not usually
      cleaved, resulting in an increased accumulation of small RNA different from
      miRNA. Therefore, our results suggest that, in addition to the distance from the 
      ssRNA-dsRNA junction, mismatches on the stem of pri-miRNA function as a
      determinant for precise processing of pri-miRNA by DCL1 in plants.

TI  - Dual control of MAPK activities by AP2C1 and MKP1 MAPK phosphatases regulates
      defence responses in Arabidopsis.
PG  - 2369-2384
LID - 10.1093/jxb/erac018 [doi]
AB  - Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades transmit environmental signals
      and induce stress and defence responses in plants. These signalling cascades are 
      negatively controlled by specific Ser/Thr protein phosphatases of the type 2C
      (PP2C) and dual-specificity phosphatase (DSP) families that inactivate
      stress-induced MAPKs; however, the interplay between phosphatases of these
      different types has remained unknown. This work reveals that different
      Arabidopsis MAPK phosphatases, the PP2C-type AP2C1 and the DSP-type MKP1, exhibit
      both specific and overlapping functions in plant stress responses. Each single
      mutant, ap2c1 and mkp1, and the ap2c1 mkp1 double mutant displayed enhanced
      stress-induced activation of the MAPKs MPK3, MPK4, and MPK6, as well as induction
      of a set of transcription factors. Moreover, ap2c1 mkp1 double mutants showed an 
      autoimmune-like response, associated with increased levels of the stress hormones
      salicylic acid and ethylene, and of the phytoalexin camalexin. This phenotype was
      reduced in the ap2c1 mkp1 mpk3 and ap2c1 mkp1 mpk6 triple mutants, suggesting
      that the autoimmune-like response is due to MAPK misregulation. We conclude that 
      the evolutionarily distant MAPK phosphatases AP2C1 and MKP1 contribute crucially 
      to the tight control of MAPK activities, ensuring appropriately balanced stress
      signalling and suppression of autoimmune-like responses during plant growth and
      development.

AB  - Reversible phosphorylation of photosystem II light harvesting complexes (LHCII)
      is a well-established protective mechanism enabling efficient response to
      changing light conditions. However, changes in LHCII phosphorylation were also
      observed in response to abiotic stress regardless of photoperiod. This study
      aimed to investigate the impact of dark-chilling on LHCII phosphorylation pattern
      in chilling-tolerant Arabidopsis thaliana and to check whether the disturbed
      LHCII phosphorylation process will impact the response of Arabidopsis to the
      dark-chilling conditions. We analyzed the pattern of LHCII phosphorylation, the
      organization of chlorophyll-protein complexes, and the level of chilling
      tolerance by combining biochemical and spectroscopy techniques under
      dark-chilling and dark conditions in Arabidopsis mutants with disrupted LHCII
      phosphorylation. Our results show that during dark-chilling, LHCII
      phosphorylation decreased in all examined plant lines and that no significant
      differences in dark-chilling response were registered in tested lines.
      Interestingly, after 24 h of darkness, a high increase in LHCII phosphorylation
      was observed, co-occurring with a significant FV/FM parameter decrease. The
      highest drop of FV/FM was detected in the stn7-1 line-mutant, where the LHCII is 
      not phosphorylated, due to the lack of STN7 kinase. Our results imply that STN7
      kinase activity is important for mitigating the adverse effects of prolonged
      darkness.

AB  - Plant secondary growth, which is the basis of wood formation, includes the
      production of secondary xylem, which is derived from meristematic cambium cells
      embedded in vascular tissue. Here, we identified an important role for the
      Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) AT-HOOK MOTIF CONTAINING NUCLEAR LOCALIZED 15 
      (AHL15) transcriptional regulator in controlling vascular cambium activity. The
      limited secondary xylem development in inflorescence stems of herbaceous
      Arabidopsis plants was significantly reduced in ahl15 loss-of-function mutants,
      whereas constitutive or vascular meristem-specific AHL15 overexpression produced 
      woody inflorescence stems. AHL15 was required for enhanced secondary xylem
      formation in the woody suppressor of overexpression of constans 1 (soc1)
      fruitfull (ful) double loss-of-function mutant. Moreover, we found that AHL15
      induces vascular cambium activity downstream of the repressing SOC1 and FUL
      transcription factors, most likely similar to how it enhances lateral branching
      by promoting biosynthesis of the hormone cytokinin. Our results uncover a novel
      pathway driving cambium development, in which AHL15 expression levels act in
      parallel to and are dependent on the well-established TDIF-PXY-WOX pathway to
      differentiate between herbaceous and woody stem growth.

TI  - Phosphorylation of RNA Polymerase II by CDKC;2 Maintains the Arabidopsis
      Circadian Clock Period.
PG  - 450-462
LID - 10.1093/pcp/pcac011 [doi]
AB  - The circadian clock is an internal timekeeping system that governs about 24 h
      biological rhythms of a broad range of developmental and metabolic activities.
      The clocks in eukaryotes are thought to rely on lineage-specific
      transcriptional-translational feedback loops. However, the mechanisms underlying 
      the basic transcriptional regulation events for clock function have not yet been 
      fully explored. Here, through a combination of chemical biology and genetic
      approaches, we demonstrate that phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II by CYCLIN
      DEPENDENT KINASE C; 2 (CDKC;2) is required for maintaining the circadian period
      in Arabidopsis. Chemical screening identified BML-259, the inhibitor of mammalian
      CDK2/CDK5, as a compound lengthening the circadian period of Arabidopsis.
      Short-term BML-259 treatment resulted in decreased expression of most
      clock-associated genes. Development of a chemical probe followed by affinity
      proteomics revealed that BML-259 binds to CDKC;2. Loss-of-function mutations of
      cdkc;2 caused a long period phenotype. In vitro experiments demonstrated that the
      CDKC;2 immunocomplex phosphorylates the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II,
      and BML-259 inhibits this phosphorylation. Collectively, this study suggests that
      transcriptional activity maintained by CDKC;2 is required for proper period
      length, which is an essential feature of the circadian clock in Arabidopsis.

LID - 10.1093/jxb/erac029 [doi]
AB  - Reactive oxygen species (ROS) contribute to cellular damage in several different 
      contexts, but their role during chilling damage is poorly defined. Chilling
      sensitivity both limits the distribution of plant species and causes devastating 
      crop losses worldwide. Our screen of chilling-tolerant Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis
      thaliana) for mutants that suffer chilling damage identified a gene (At4g03410)
      encoding a chloroplast Mpv17_PMP22 protein, MPD1, with no previous connection to 
      chilling. The chilling-sensitive mpd1-1 mutant is an overexpression allele that
      we successfully phenocopied by creating transgenic lines with a similar level of 
      MPD1 overexpression. In mammals and yeast, MPD1 homologs are associated with ROS 
      management. In chilling conditions, Arabidopsis overexpressing MPD1 accumulated
      H2O2 to higher levels than wild-type controls and exhibited stronger induction of
      ROS response genes. Paraquat application exacerbated chilling damage, confirming 
      that the phenotype occurs due to ROS dysregulation. We conclude that at low
      temperature increased MPD1 expression results in increased ROS production,
      causing chilling damage. Our discovery of the effect of MPD1 overexpression on
      ROS production under chilling stress implies that investigation of the nine other
      members of the Mpv17_PMP22 family in Arabidopsis may lead to new discoveries
      regarding ROS signaling and management in plants.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objective of this data set was to identify how interaction
      between temperature and the sickle-3 (sic-3) mutant alters the global messenger
      RNA (mRNA) content of Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings. The motivation was
      discovery of atypical mRNA splice variants in sic-3 that differed with seedling
      growth temperature. The expected outcome was identification of mRNA splice
      variants altered by sic-3, temperature, or the combination of temperature and
      genotype. DATA DESCRIPTION: The data set is RNAseq profiling of Arabidopsis
      (Col-0 ecotype) wild type and sic-3 seedlings under 16 degrees C or 28 degrees C.
      A comprehensive view of global mRNA sequences and their content was captured by
      deep sequencing of RNA pools made from sets of seedlings sampled every 4 h over
      20 h. This data set contains sequences representing the spectrum of mRNA splice
      variants from individual genes, as well as from mRNA-related sequences like
      spliced introns. This data set enables detection of significant changes in
      gene-level expression and relative levels of mRNA splice variants caused by the
      different growth temperatures, the sic-3 mutation or both factors. This data set 
      is useful to study production of mRNA splice variants and other mRNA-related RNAs
      in a range of plant species because Arabidopsis is a model plant.

TI  - Characterization of photosystem II assembly complexes containing ONE-HELIX
      PROTEIN1 in Arabidopsis thaliana.

LID - 10.1007/s10265-022-01376-x [doi]
AB  - The assembly process of photosystem II (PSII) requires several auxiliary proteins
      to form assembly intermediates. In plants, early assembly intermediates comprise 
      D1 and D2 subunits of PSII together with a few auxiliary proteins including at
      least ONE-HELIX PROTEIN1 (OHP1), OHP2, and HIGH-CHLOROPHYLL FLUORESCENCE 244
      (HCF244) proteins. Herein, we report the basic characterization of the assembling
      intermediates, which we purified from Arabidopsis transgenic plants
      overexpressing a tagged OHP1 protein and named the OHP1 complexes. We analyzed
      two major forms of OHP1 complexes by mass spectrometry, which revealed that the
      complexes consist of OHP1, OHP2, and HCF244 in addition to the PSII subunits D1, 
      D2, and cytochrome b559. Analysis of chlorophyll fluorescence showed that a major
      form of the complex binds chlorophyll a and carotenoids and performs quenching
      with a time constant of 420 ps. To identify the localization of the auxiliary
      proteins, we solubilized thylakoid membranes using a digitonin derivative,
      glycodiosgenin, and separated them into three fractions by ultracentrifugation,
      and detected these proteins in the loose pellet containing the stroma lamellae
      and the grana margins together with two chlorophyll biosynthesis enzymes. The
      results indicated that chlorophyll biosynthesis and assembly may take place in
      the same compartments of thylakoid membranes. Inducible suppression of the OHP2
      mRNA substantially decreased the OHP2 protein in mature Arabidopsis leaves
      without a significant reduction in the maximum quantum yield of PSII under
      low-light conditions, but it compromised the yields under high-light conditions. 
      This implies that the auxiliary protein is required for acclimation to high-light
      conditions.

TI  - The UPR regulator IRE1 promotes balanced organ development by restricting
      TOR-dependent control of cellular differentiation in Arabidopsis.
PG  - 1229-1248
LID - 10.1111/tpj.15629 [doi]
AB  - Proteostasis of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is controlled by sophisticated
      signaling pathways that are collectively called the unfolded protein response
      (UPR) and are initiated by specialized ER membrane-associated sensors. The
      evidence that complete loss-of-function mutations of the most conserved of the
      UPR sensors, inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), dysregulates tissue growth and
      development in metazoans and plants raises the fundamental question as to how
      IRE1 is connected to organismal growth. To address this question, we interrogated
      the Arabidopsis primary root, an established model for organ development, using
      the tractable Arabidopsis IRE1 mutant ire1a ire1b, which has marked root
      development defects in the absence of exogenous stress. We demonstrate that IRE1 
      is required to reach maximum rates of cell elongation and root growth. We also
      established that in the actively growing ire1a ire1b mutant root tips the Target 
      of Rapamycin (TOR) kinase, a widely conserved pro-growth regulator, is
      hyperactive, and that, unlike cell proliferation, the rate of cell
      differentiation is enhanced in ire1a ire1b in a TOR-dependent manner. By
      functionally connecting two essential growth regulators, these results underpin a
      novel and critical role of IRE1 in organ development and indicate that, as cells 
      exit an undifferentiated state, IRE1 is required to monitor TOR activity to
      balance cell expansion and maturation during organ biogenesis.

TI  - MYB2 Is Important for Tapetal PCD and Pollen Development by Directly Activating
      Protease Expression in Arabidopsis.
LID - 3563 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23073563 [doi]
AB  - Tapetal programmed cell death (PCD) is a complex biological process that plays an
      important role in pollen formation and reproduction. Here, we identified the MYB2
      transcription factor expressed in the tapetum from stage 5 to stage 11 that was
      essential for tapetal PCD and pollen development in
      Arabidopsis&amp;nbsp;thaliana. Downregulation of MYB2 retarded tapetal
      degeneration, produced defective pollen, and decreased pollen vitality. EMSA and 
      transcriptional activation analysis revealed that MYB2 acted as an upstream
      activator and directly regulated expression of the proteases CEP1 and betaVPE.
      The expression of these proteases was lower in the buds of the myb2 mutant.
      Overexpression of either/both CEP1 or/and betaVPE proteases partially recover
      pollen vitality in the myb2 background. Taken together, our results revealed that
      MYB2 regulates tapetal PCD and pollen development by directly activating
      expression of the proteases CEP1 and betaVPE. Thus, a transcription
      factor/proteases regulatory and activated cascade was established for tapetal PCD
      during another development in Arabidopsis&amp;nbsp;thaliana. Highlight: MYB2 is
      involved in tapetal PCD and pollen development by directly regulating expression 
      of the protease CEP1 and betaVPE and establishes a transcription factor/proteases
      regulatory and activated cascade.

LID - 10.1007/s00425-022-03872-9 [doi]
AB  - MAIN CONCLUSION: Genetic analysis reveals a previously unknown role for ethylene 
      signaling in regulating Arabidopsis thaliana nitrogen metabolism. Nitrogen (N) is
      essential for plant growth, and assimilation of soil nitrate (NO3(-)) and
      ammonium ions is an important route of N acquisition. Although N import and
      assimilation are subject to multiple regulatory inputs, the extent to which
      ethylene signaling contributes to this regulation remains poorly understood.
      Here, our analysis of Arabidopsis thaliana ethylene signaling mutants advances
      that understanding. We show that the loss of CTR1 function ctr1-1 mutation
      confers resistance to the toxic effects of the NO3(-) analogue chlorate
      (ClO3(-)), and reduces the activity of the nitrate reductase (NR) enzyme of
      NO3(-) assimilation. Our further analysis indicates that the lack of the
      downstream EIN2 component (conferred by novel ein2 mutations) suppresses the
      effect of ctr1-1, restoring ClO3(-) sensitivity and NR activity to normal.
      Collectively, our observations indicate an important role for ethylene signaling 
      in regulating Arabidopsis thaliana NO3(-) metabolism. We conclude that ethylene
      signaling enables environmentally responsive coordination of plant growth and N
      metabolism.

AB  - The N-terminal acetylation of proteins is a key modification in eukaryotes.
      However, knowledge of the biological function of N-terminal acetylation
      modification of proteins in plants is limited. Naa50 is the catalytic subunit of 
      the N-terminal acetyltransferase NatE complex. We previously demonstrated that
      the absence of Naa50 leads to sterility in Arabidopsis thaliana. In the present
      study, the lack of Naa50 resulted in collapsed and sterile pollen in Arabidopsis.
      Further experiments showed that the mutation in Naa50 accelerated programmed cell
      death in the tapetum. Expression pattern analysis revealed the specific
      expression of Naa50 in the tapetum cells of anthers at 9-11 stages during pollen 
      development, when tapetal programmed cell death occurred. Reciprocal cross
      analyses indicated that male sterility in naa50 is caused by sporophytic effects.
      mRNA sequencing and quantitative PCR of the closed buds showed that the deletion 
      of Naa50 resulted in the upregulation of the cysteine protease coding gene CEP1
      and impaired the expression of several genes involved in pollen wall deposition
      and pollen mitotic division. The collective data suggest that Naa50 balances the 
      degradation of tapetum cells during anther development and plays an important
      role in pollen development by affecting several pathways.

TI  - A SA-regulated lincRNA promotes Arabidopsis disease resistance by modulating
      pre-rRNA processing.

AB  - Regulation of gene expression at translational level has been shown critical for 
      plant defense against pathogen infection. Pre-rRNA processing is essential for
      ribosome biosynthesis and thus affects protein translation. It remains unknown if
      plants modulate pre-rRNA processing as a translation regulatory mechanism for
      disease resistance. In this study, we show a 5' snoRNA capped and 3'
      polyadenylated (SPA) lincRNA named SUNA1 promotes disease resistance involved in 
      modulating pre-rRNA processing in Arabidopsis. SUNA1 expression is highly induced
      by Pst DC3000 infection, which is impaired in SA biosynthesis-defective mutant
      sid2 and signaling mutant npr1. Consistently, SA triggers SUNA1 expression
      dependent on NPR1. Functional analysis indicates that SUNA1 plays a positive role
      in Arabidopsis defense against Pst DC3000 relying on its snoRNA signature motifs.
      Potential mechanism study suggests that the nucleus-localized SUNA1 interacts
      with the nucleolar methyltransferase fibrillarin to modulate SA-controlled
      pre-rRNA processing, then enhancing the translational efficiency (TE) of some
      defense genes in Arabidopsis response to Pst DC3000 infection. NPR1 appears to
      have similar effects as SUNA1 on pre-rRNA processing and TE of defense genes.
      Together, these studies reveal one kind of undescribed antibacterial translation 
      regulatory mechanism, in which SA-NPR1-SUNA1 signaling cascade controls pre-rRNA 
      processing and TE of certain defense genes in Arabidopsis.

TI  - BREVIPEDICELLUS and ERECTA control the expression of AtPRX17 to prevent
      Arabidopsis callus browning.
PG  - 1516-1532
LID - 10.1093/jxb/erab512 [doi]
AB  - Efficient in vitro callus generation is required for tissue culture propagation, 
      a process that allows for plant regeneration and transgenic breeding for desired 
      phenotypes. Identifying genes and regulatory elements that prevent impaired
      callus growth and callus browning is essential for the development of in vitro
      callus systems. Here, we show that the BREVIPEDICELLUS and ERECTA pathways in
      Arabidopsis calli converge to prevent callus browning, and positively regulate
      the expression of the isoperoxidase gene AtPRX17 in rapidly growing calli.
      Loss-of-function mutations in both BREVIPEDICELLUS and ERECTA resulted in
      markedly increased callus browning. Transgenic lines expressing 35S pro::AtPRX17 
      in the bp-5 er105 double mutant background fully rescued this phenotypic
      abnormality. Using in vivo (chromatin immunoprecipitation-PCR and transient
      expression) and in vitro (electrophoretic mobility shift assays) assays, we
      observed that the BREVIPEDICELLUS protein binds directly to the upstream sequence
      of AtPRX17 to promote its transcription during callus growth. ERECTA is a
      ubiquitous factor required for cell proliferation and growth. We show that ERECTA
      positively regulates the expression of the transcription factor WRKY6, which
      directly binds to a separate site on the AtPRX17 promoter, further increasing its
      expression. Our data reveal an important molecular mechanism involved in the
      regulation of peroxidase isozyme expression to reduce Arabidopsis callus
      browning.

TI  - MISF2 Encodes an Essential Mitochondrial Splicing Cofactor Required for nad2 mRNA
      Processing and Embryo Development in Arabidopsis thaliana.
LID - 2670 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23052670 [doi]
AB  - Mitochondria play key roles in cellular energy metabolism in eukaryotes.
      Mitochondria of most organisms contain their own genome and specific
      transcription and translation machineries. The expression of angiosperm mtDNA
      involves extensive RNA-processing steps, such as RNA trimming, editing, and the
      splicing of numerous group II-type introns. Pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR)
      proteins are key players in plant organelle gene expression and RNA metabolism.
      In the present analysis, we reveal the function of the MITOCHONDRIAL SPLICING
      FACTOR 2 gene (MISF2, AT3G22670) and show that it encodes a
      mitochondria-localized PPR protein that is crucial for early embryo development
      in Arabidopsis. Molecular characterization of embryo-rescued misf2 plantlets
      indicates that the splicing of nad2 intron 1, and thus respiratory complex I
      biogenesis, are strongly compromised. Moreover, the molecular function seems
      conserved between MISF2 protein in Arabidopsis and its orthologous gene (EMP10)
      in maize, suggesting that the ancestor of MISF2/EMP10 was recruited to function
      in nad2 processing before the monocot-dicot divergence ~200 million years ago.
      These data provide new insights into the function of nuclear-encoded factors in
      mitochondrial gene expression and respiratory chain biogenesis during plant
      embryo development.

AB  - MAIN CONCLUSION: Extracellular ATP level induced a transient increase during
      germination of Arabidopsis seeds, and extracellular ATP could negatively regulate
      the seed germination by its receptor, DORN1. Extracellular ATP (exATP) acts as a 
      signal molecule for regulating growth, development, and responses of plants to
      external environments. In this study, we investigated the possible involvement of
      exATP in regulating the seed germination of Arabidopsis thaliana. Treatments of
      Arabidopsis seeds with exogenous ATP delayed seed germination, suggesting that
      exATP could be a repressor for seed germination. During the germination of
      Arabidopsis seeds, the exATP level of the seeds presented a transient increase.
      When exogenous application of the glucose-hexokinase system effectively decreased
      the exATP level of the Arabidopsis seeds during germination, the percentage of
      germination was significantly enhanced, while the products of ATP hydrolysis had 
      no effects on the germination. Further studies showed that the seeds of dorn 1-3 
      mutant plants (mutation in exATP receptor) showed a higher germination
      percentage, compared to the seeds of wide type (WT) plants. In addition, the dorn
      1-3 mutant seeds were less sensitive to the delay-effect of exogenous ATP on seed
      germination than the WT seeds. The dorn 1-3 mutant seeds presented a higher GA
      (gibberellin) content, lower ABA (abscisic acid) content, and lower ratio of
      ABA/GA contents before the imbibition, compared to the WT seeds. The regulation
      of seed germination by exATP was dependent on the external temperature. These
      data suggest that exATP is involved in regulating Arabidopsis seed germination.

TI  - Specialist Aphid Feeding Causes Local Activation of Salicylic and Jasmonic Acid
      Signaling in Arabidopsis Veins.
PG  - 119-124
LID - 10.1094/MPMI-08-21-0203-SC [doi]
AB  - Aphids, the phloem sap feeders, probe into leaf tissues and activate a complex
      network of plant defense responses. Phytohormonal signaling plays a major role in
      this network; however, the dynamics of the signal spreading is yet to be
      clarified. Despite the growing knowledge about transcriptomic changes upon
      infestation, results often differ due to sampling, varying strongly between the
      tissues collected at the single feeding site, individual leaves, pooled infested 
      leaves, or whole plant rosettes. This study focuses on activation of salicylic
      acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA) signals in Arabidopsis leaves during infestation
      by cabbage aphid (Brevicoryne brassicae) in high spatio-temporal resolution. We
      used genetically encoded fluorescent biosensors, histochemistry, and quantitative
      reverse transcription-PCR to precisely map activation of distinct branches of
      phytohormonal signaling. We found a rapid induction of SA and JA signaling
      markers in cells surrounding stylet puncture, colocalizing with callose
      deposition. For both PR1 and JAZ10, we detected activation at 24 h
      postinfestation (hpi), increasing and spreading along the veins until 72 hpi and,
      to a lesser extent, within the epidermal pavement cells. The SA signaling wave
      appeared in parallel with JA-associated signaling and continued to increase in
      time. Our results first show a local activation of SA- and JA-related responses
      after stylet penetration of Arabidopsis leaves and bring a detailed insight into 
      the spatio-temporal complexity of plant defense activation during specialist
      aphid attack.[Formula: see text] Copyright (c) 2022 The Author(s). This is an

TI  - MAP3Kepsilon1/2 Interact with MOB1A/1B and Play Important Roles in Control of
      Pollen Germination through Crosstalk with JA Signaling in Arabidopsis.
LID - 2683 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23052683 [doi]
AB  - Restriction of pollen germination before the pollen grain is pollinated to stigma
      is essential for successful fertilization in angiosperms. However, the mechanisms
      underlying the process remain poorly understood. Here, we report functional
      characterization of the MAPKKK kinases, MAP3Kepsilon1 and MAP3Kepsilon2, involve 
      in control of pollen germination in Arabidopsis. The two genes were expressed in 
      different tissues with higher expression levels in the tricellular pollen grains.
      The map3kepsilon1 map3kepsilon2 double mutation caused abnormal callose
      accumulation, increasing level of JA and precocious pollen germination, resulting
      in significantly reduced seed set. Furthermore, the map3kepsilon1 map3kepsilon2
      double mutations obviously upregulated the expression levels of genes in JA
      biosynthesis and signaling. The MAP3Kepsilon1/2 interacted with MOB1A/1B which
      shared homology with the core components of Hippo singling pathway in yeast. The 
      Arabidopsis mob1a mob1b mutant also exhibited a similar phenotype of precocious
      pollen germination to that in map3kepsilon1 map3kepsilon2 mutants. Taken
      together, these results suggested that the MAP3Kepsilons interacted with MOB1s
      and played important role in restriction of the precocious pollen germination,
      possibly through crosstalk with JA signaling and influencing callose accumulation
      in Arabidopsis.

TI  - FDDM1 and FDDM2, Two SGS3-like Proteins, Function as a Complex to Affect DNA
      Methylation in Arabidopsis.
LID - 339 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/genes13020339 [doi]
AB  - DNA methylation is an important epigenetic modification required for the specific
      regulation of gene expression and the maintenance of genome stability in plants
      and animals. However, the mechanism of DNA demethylation remains largely unknown.
      Here, we show that two SGS3-like proteins, FACTOR OF DNA DEMETHYLATION 1 (FDDM1) 
      and FDDM2, negatively affect the DNA methylation levels at ROS1-dependend DNA
      loci in Arabidopsis. FDDM1 binds dsRNAs with 5' overhangs through its XS (rice
      gene X and SGS3) domain and forms a heterodimer with FDDM2 through its XH (rice
      gene X Homology) domain. A lack of FDDM1 or FDDM2 increased DNA methylation
      levels at several ROS1-dependent DNA loci. However, FDDM1 and FDDM2 may not have 
      an additive effect on DNA methylation levels. Moreover, the XS and XH domains are
      required for the function of FDDM1. Taken together, these results suggest that
      FDDM1 and FDDM2 act as a heterodimer to positively modulate DNA demethylation.
      Our finding extends the function of plant-specific SGS3-like proteins.

TI  - The Absence of the AtSYT1 Function Elevates the Adverse Effect of Salt Stress on 
      Photosynthesis in Arabidopsis.
LID - 1751 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23031751 [doi]
AB  - Arabidopsis thaliana SYNAPTOTAGMIN 1 (AtSYT1) was shown to be involved in
      responses to different environmental and biotic stresses. We investigated gas
      exchange and chlorophyll a fluorescence in Arabidopsis wild-type (WT, ecotype
      Col-0) and atsyt1 mutant plants irrigated for 48 h with 150 mM NaCl. We found
      that salt stress significantly decreases net photosynthetic assimilation,
      effective photochemical quantum yield of photosystem II (PhiPSII), stomatal
      conductance and transpiration rate in both genotypes. Salt stress has a more
      severe impact on atsyt1 plants with increasing effect at higher illumination.
      Dark respiration, photochemical quenching (qP), non-photochemical quenching and
      PhiPSII measured at 750 micromol m(-2) s(-1) photosynthetic photon flux density
      were significantly affected by salt in both genotypes. However, differences
      between mutant and WT plants were recorded only for qP and PhiPSII. Decreased
      photosynthetic efficiency in atsyt1 under salt stress was accompanied by reduced 
      chlorophyll and carotenoid and increased flavonol content in atsyt1 leaves. No
      differences in the abundance of key proteins participating in photosynthesis
      (except PsaC and PsbQ) and chlorophyll biosynthesis were found regardless of
      genotype or salt treatment. Microscopic analysis showed that irrigating plants
      with salt caused a partial closure of the stomata, and this effect was more
      pronounced in the mutant than in WT plants. The localization pattern of AtSYT1
      was also altered by salt stress.

TI  - A unique miR775-GALT9 module regulates leaf senescence in Arabidopsis during
      post-submergence recovery by modulating ethylene and the abscisic acid pathway.
LID - dev199974 [pii]
LID - 10.1242/dev.199974 [doi]
AB  - The submergence-induced hypoxic condition negatively affects the plant growth and
      development, and causes early onset of senescence. Hypoxia alters the expression 
      of a number of microRNAs (miRNAs). However, the molecular function of submergence
      stress-induced miRNAs in physiological or developmental changes and recovery
      remains poorly understood. Here, we show that miR775 is an Arabidopsis
      thaliana-specific young and unique miRNA that possibly evolved non-canonically.
      miR775 post-transcriptionally regulates GALACTOSYLTRANSFERASE 9 (GALT9) and their
      expression is inversely affected at 24 h of complete submergence stress. The
      overexpression of miR775 (miR775-Oe) confers enhanced recovery from submergence
      stress and reduced accumulation of RBOHD and ROS, in contrast to wild-type and
      MIM775 Arabidopsis shoot. A similar recovery phenotype in the galt9 mutant
      indicates the role of the miR775-GALT9 module in post-submergence recovery. We
      predicted that Golgi-localized GALT9 is potentially involved in protein
      glycosylation. The altered expression of senescence-associated genes (SAG12,
      SAG29 and ORE1), ethylene signalling (EIN2 and EIN3) and abscisic acid (ABA)
      biosynthesis (NCED3) pathway genes occurs in miR775-Oe, galt9 and MIM775 plants. 
      Thus, our results indicate the role for the miR775-GALT9 module in
      post-submergence recovery through a crosstalk between the ethylene signalling and
      ABA biosynthesis pathways.

TI  - FIONA1-Mediated m(6) A Modification Regulates the Floral Transition in
      Arabidopsis.
PG  - e2103628
LID - 10.1002/advs.202103628 [doi]
AB  - N(6) -methyladenosine (m(6) A) mRNA modification represents the most widespread
      form of internal modifications in eukaryotic mRNAs. In the model plant
      Arabidopsis thaliana, those known methyltransferases mainly deposit m(6) A at
      their target transcripts near the stop codon or in the 3' untranslated region.
      Here, it is reported that FIONA1 (FIO1), a human METTL16 ortholog, acts as a
      hitherto unknown m(6) A methyltransferase that determines m(6) A modifications at
      over 2000 Arabidopsis transcripts predominantly in the coding region. Mutants of 
      FIO1 show a decrease in global m(6) A mRNA methylation levels and an
      early-flowering phenotype. Nanopore direct RNA sequencing reveals that FIO1 is
      required for establishing appropriate levels of m(6) A preferentially in the
      coding sequences of a subset of protein-coding transcripts, which is associated
      with changes in transcript abundance and alternative polyadenylation. It is
      further demonstrated that FIO1-mediated m(6) A methylation determines the mRNA
      abundance of a central flowering integrator SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF
      CONSTANS 1 (SOC1) and its upstream regulators, thus preventing premature
      flowering. The findings reveal that FIO1 acts as a unique m(6) A
      methyltransferase that mainly modifies the coding regions of transcripts, which
      underlies the key developmental transition from vegetative to reproductive growth
      in plants.

TI  - ADH2/GSNOR1 is a key player in limiting genotoxic damage mediated by formaldehyde
      and UV-B in Arabidopsis.
PG  - 378-391
LID - 10.1111/pce.14249 [doi]
AB  - Maintenance of genome stability is an essential requirement for all living
      organisms. Formaldehyde and UV-B irradiation cause DNA damage and affect genome
      stability, growth and development, but the interplay between these two genotoxic 
      factors is poorly understood in plants. We show that Arabidopsis adh2/gsnor1
      mutant, which lacks alcohol dehydrogenase 2/S-nitrosoglutathione reductase 1
      (ADH2/GSNOR1), are hypersensitive to low fluence UV-B irradiation or UV-B
      irradiation-mimetic chemicals. Although the ADH2/GSNOR1 enzyme can act on
      different substrates, notably on S-hydroxymethylglutathione (HMG) and
      S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), our study provides several lines of evidence that
      the sensitivity of gsnor1 to UV-B is caused mainly by UV-B-induced formaldehyde
      accumulation rather than other factors such as alteration of the GSNO
      concentration. Our results demonstrate an interplay between formaldehyde and UV-B
      that exacerbates genome instability, leading to severe DNA damage and impaired
      growth and development in Arabidopsis, and show that ADH2/GSNOR1 is a key player 
      in combating these effects.

TI  - H2S aids osmotic stress resistance by S-sulfhydration of melatonin
      production-related enzymes in Arabidopsis thaliana.
PG  - 365-376
LID - 10.1007/s00299-021-02813-2 [doi]
AB  - KEY MESSAGE: Hydrogen sulfide closed Arabidopsis thaliana stomata by increasing
      the transcription of melatonin-producing enzymes and the post-translational
      modification levels to combat osmotic stress. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and
      melatonin (MEL) reportedly have similar functions in many aspects of plant
      growth, development and stress response. They regulate stomatal movement and
      enhance drought resistance. However, their physiological relationship is not well
      understood. Here, their crosstalk involved in osmotic stress resistance in
      Arabidopsis thaliana was studied. Exogenous H2S and MEL closed stomata under
      normal or osmotic stress conditions and increased the relative water contents of 
      plants under osmotic stress conditions. At the same time, exogenous H2S and MEL
      responded to osmotic stress by increasing the content of proline and soluble
      sugar, and reducing malondialdehyde (MDA) content and relative conductivity.
      Using mutants in the MEL-associated production of serotonin N-acetyltransferase
      (snat), caffeic acid O-methyltransferase (comt1) and N-acetylserotonin
      methyltransferase (asmt), we determined that H2S was partially dependent on MEL
      to close stomata. Additionally, the overexpression of ASMT promoted stomatal
      closure. Exogenous H2S increased the transcription levels of SNAT, ASMT and
      COMT1. Furthermore, exogenous H2S treatments increased the endogenous MEL content
      significantly. At the post-translational level, H2S sulfhydrated the SNAT and
      ASMT, but not COMT1, enzymes associated with MEL production. Thus, H2S appeared
      to promote stomatal closure in response to osmotic stress by increasing the
      transcription levels of MEL synthesis-related genes and the sulfhydryl
      modification of the encoded enzymes. These results increased our understanding of
      H2S and MEL functions and interactions under osmotic stress conditions.

TI  - The small RNA-mediated gene silencing machinery is required in Arabidopsis for
      stimulation of growth, systemic disease resistance, and suppression of the
      nitrile-specifier gene NSP4 by Trichoderma atroviride.
PG  - 873-890
LID - 10.1111/tpj.15599 [doi]
AB  - Trichoderma atroviride is a root-colonizing fungus that confers multiple benefits
      to plants. In plants, small RNA (sRNA)-mediated gene silencing (sRNA-MGS) plays
      pivotal roles in growth, development, and pathogen attack. Here, we explored the 
      role of core components of Arabidopsis thaliana sRNA-MGS pathways during its
      interaction with Trichoderma. Upon interaction with Trichoderma, sRNA-MGS-related
      genes paralleled the expression of Arabidopsis defense-related genes, linked to
      salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA) pathways. SA- and JA-related genes
      were primed by Trichoderma in leaves after the application of the well-known
      pathogen-associated molecular patterns flg22 and chitin, respectively.
      Defense-related genes were primed in roots as well, but to different extents and 
      behaviors. Phenotypical characterization of mutants in AGO genes and components
      of the RNA-dependent DNA methylation (RdDM) pathway revealed that different sets 
      of sRNA-MGS-related genes are essential for (i) the induction of systemic
      acquired resistance against Botrytis cinerea, (ii) the activation of the
      expression of plant defense-related genes, and (iii) root colonization by
      Trichoderma. Additionally, plant growth induced by Trichoderma depends on
      functional RdDM. Profiling of DNA methylation and histone N-tail modification
      patterns at the Arabidopsis Nitrile-Specifier Protein-4 (NSP4) locus, which is
      responsive to Trichoderma, showed altered epigenetic modifications in RdDM
      mutants. Furthermore, NSP4 is required for the induction of systemic acquired
      resistance against Botrytis and avoidance of enhanced root colonization by
      Trichoderma. Together, our results indicate that RdDM is essential in Arabidopsis
      to establish a beneficial relationship with Trichoderma. We propose that DNA
      methylation and histone modifications are required for plant priming by the
      beneficial fungus against B. cinerea.

TI  - Arabidopsis inositol polyphosphate kinases IPK1 and ITPK1 modulate crosstalk
      between SA-dependent immunity and phosphate-starvation responses.
PG  - 347-363
LID - 10.1007/s00299-021-02812-3 [doi]
AB  - KEY MESSAGE: Selective Arabidopsis thaliana inositol phosphate kinase functions
      modulate response amplitudes in innate immunity by balancing signalling
      adjustments with phosphate homeostasis networks. Pyrophosphorylation of InsP6
      generates InsP7 and/or InsP8 containing high-energy phosphoanhydride bonds that
      are harnessed during energy requirements of a cell. As bona fide co-factors for
      several phytohormone networks, InsP7/InsP8 modulate key developmental processes. 
      With requirements in transducing jasmonic acid (JA) and phosphate-starvation
      responses (PSR), InsP8 exemplifies a versatile metabolite for crosstalks between 
      different cellular pathways during diverse stress exposures. Here we show that
      Arabidopsis thaliana INOSITOL PENTAKISPHOSPHATE 2-KINASE 1 (IPK1), INOSITOL
      1,3,4-TRISPHOSPHATE 5/6-KINASE 1 (ITPK1), and DIPHOSPHOINOSITOL PENTAKISPHOSPHATE
      KINASE 2 (VIH2) implicated in InsP8 biosynthesis, suppress salicylic acid
      (SA)-dependent immunity. In ipk1, itpk1 or vih2 mutants, constitutive activation 
      of defenses lead to enhanced resistance against the Pseudomonas syringae pv
      tomato DC3000 (PstDC3000) strain. Our data reveal that upregulated SA-signaling
      sectors potentiate increased expression of several phosphate-starvation inducible
      (PSI)-genes, previously known in these mutants. In reciprocation, upregulated
      PSI-genes moderate expression amplitudes of defense-associated markers. We
      demonstrate that SA is induced in phosphate-deprived plants, however its
      defense-promoting functions are likely diverted to PSR-supportive roles. Overall,
      our investigations reveal selective InsPs as crosstalk mediators in
      defense-phosphate homeostasis and in reprogramming stress-appropriate response
      intensities.

TI  - The DROL1 subunit of U5 snRNP in the spliceosome is specifically required to
      splice AT-AC-type introns in Arabidopsis.
PG  - 633-648
LID - 10.1111/tpj.15582 [doi]
AB  - An Arabidopsis mutant named defective repression of OLE3::LUC 1 (drol1) was
      originally isolated as a mutant with defects in the repression of OLEOSIN3 (OLE3)
      after seed germination. In this study, we show that DROL1 is an Arabidopsis
      homolog of yeast DIB1, a subunit of the U5 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein
      particle (snRNP) in the spliceosome. It is also part of a new subfamily that is
      specific to a certain class of eukaryotes. Comprehensive analysis of the intron
      splicing using RNA sequencing analysis of the drol1 mutants revealed that most of
      the minor introns with AT-AC dinucleotide termini had reduced levels of splicing.
      Only two nucleotide substitutions from AT-AC to GT-AG enabled AT-AC-type introns 
      to be spliced in drol1 mutants. Forty-eight genes, including those having
      important roles in abiotic stress responses and cell proliferation, exhibited
      reduced splicing of AT-AC-type introns in the drol1 mutants. Additionally, drol1 
      mutant seedlings showed retarded growth, similar to that caused by the activation
      of abscisic acid signaling, possibly as a result of reduced AT-AC-type intron
      splicing in the endosomal Na(+) /H(+) antiporters and plant-specific histone
      deacetylases. These results indicate that DROL1 is specifically involved in the
      splicing of minor introns with AT-AC termini and that this plays an important
      role in plant growth and development.

TI  - Non-TZF Transcriptional Activator AtC3H12 Negatively Affects Seed Germination and
      Seedling Development in Arabidopsis.
LID - 1572 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23031572 [doi]
AB  - CCCH zinc finger proteins are a large protein family and are classified as either
      tandem CCCH zinc finger (TZF) or non-TZF proteins. The roles of TZF genes in
      several plants have been well determined, whereas the functions of many non-TZF
      genes in plants remain uncharacterized. Herein, we describe biological and
      molecular functions of AtC3H12, an Arabidopsis non-TZF protein containing three
      CCCH zinc finger motifs. AtC3H12 has orthologs in several plant species but has
      no paralog in Arabidopsis. AtC3H12-overexpressing transgenic plants (OXs)
      germinated slower than wild-type (WT) plants, whereas atc3h12 mutants germinated 
      faster than WT plants. The fresh weight (FW) and primary root lengths of AtC3H12 
      OX seedlings were lighter and shorter than those of WT seedlings, respectively.
      In contrast, FW and primary root lengths of atc3h12 seedlings were heavier and
      longer than those of WT seedlings, respectively. AtC3H12 was localized in the
      nucleus and displayed transactivation activity in both yeast and Arabidopsis. We 
      found that the 97-197 aa region of AtC3H12 is an important part for its
      transactivation activity. Detection of expression levels and analysis of
      Arabidopsis transgenic plants harboring a PAtC3H12::GUS construct showed that
      AtC3H12 expression increases as the Arabidopsis seedlings develop. Taken
      together, our results demonstrate that AtC3H12 negatively affects seed
      germination and seedling development as a nuclear transcriptional activator in
      Arabidopsis. To our knowledge, this is the first report to show that non-TZF
      proteins negatively affect plant development as nuclear transcriptional
      activators.

      accumulation in Arabidopsis.

AB  - Anthocyanin accumulation is a marked phenotype of plants under environmental
      stresses. PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTORs (PIFs) are involved in
      environment-induced anthocyanin biosynthesis through interacting with the
      MYB-bHLH-WD40 (MBW) complex. However, the molecular mechanism of this interaction
      remains unclear. The present study demonstrated that PIF3 and PIF5 can slightly
      repress anthocyanin accumulation under NaCl, low nitrogen (-N), or 6-BA
      treatments; in contrast, PIF4 can significantly repress anthocyanin accumulation.
      Bimolecular fluorescence complementation and yeast two-hybrid assays showed that 
      PIF4 directly interacts with PRODUCTION OF ANTHOCYANIN PIGMENT 1 (PAP1), a MYB
      transcription factor in the MBW complex. Further analysis revealed that the
      active phytochrome binding (APB) domain in the N terminus of PIF4 is necessary
      for the interaction between PIF4 and PAP1. Yeast three-hybrid analysis showed
      that PIF4 competes with TRANSPARENT TESTA 8 (TT8) to bind PAP1, thereby
      interfering with the regulation of the MBW protein complex in anthocyanin
      synthesis. Consistently, the anthocyanin content in pap1-D/35S::PIF4 and
      35S::PAP1/35S::PIF4 seedlings was markedly lower than that in pap1-D and
      35S::PAP1 under 6-BA, MeJA, -N, and NaCl stresses, implying that overexpression
      of PIF4 suppresses anthocyanin accumulation in pap1-D and 35S::PAP1. Thus, PIF4
      is genetically epistatic to PAP1. Taken together, PIF4 plays a negative role in
      modulating anthocyanin biosynthesis in Arabidopsis under different stress
      environments, and PIF4 interacts with PAP1 to affect the integrity of the MBW
      complex.

AB  - Application of nanopesticides may substantially increase surface attachment and
      internalization of engineered nanoparticles (ENPs) in food crops. This study
      investigated the role of stomata in the internalization of silver nanoparticles
      (Ag NPs) using abscisic acid (ABA)-responsive ecotypes (Ler and Col-7) and
      ABA-insensitive mutants (ost1-2 and scord7) of Arabidopsis thaliana in batch
      sorption experiments, in combination with microscopic visualization. Compared
      with those of the ABA-free control, stomatal apertures were significantly smaller
      for the Ler and Col-7 ecotypes (p < 0.05) but remained unchanged for the ost1-2
      and scord7 mutants, after exposure to 10 muM ABA for 1 h. Generally Ag NP
      sorption to the leaves of the Ler and Col-7 ecotypes treated with 10 muM ABA was 
      lower than that in the ABA-free control, mainly due to ABA-induced stomatal
      closure. The difference in Ag NP sorption with and without ABA was less
      pronounced for Col-7 than for Ler, suggesting different sorption behaviors
      between these two ecotypes. In contrast, there was no significant difference in
      foliar sorption of Ag NPs by the ost1-2 and scord7 mutants with and without ABA
      treatment. Ag NPs were widely attached to the Arabidopsis leaf surface, and found
      at cell membrane, cytoplasm, and plasmodesmata, as revealed by scanning electron 
      microscopy and transmission electron microscopy, respectively. These results
      highlight the important role of stomata in the internationalization of ENPs in
      plants and may have broad implications in foliar application of nanopesticides
      and minimizing contamination of food crops by ENPs.

AB  - F-box protein genes have been shown to play vital roles in plant development and 
      stress respones. In Arabidopsis, there are more than 600 F-box proteins, and most
      of their functions are unclear. The present study shows that the F-box
      (SKP1-Cullin/CDC53-F-box) gene At5g15710 (Salt and Drought Responsiveness, SDR)
      is involved in abiotic stress responses in Arabidopsis. SDR is expressed in all
      tissues of Arabidopsis and is upregulated by salt and heat stresses and ABA
      treatment but downregulated by drought stress. Subcellular localization analysis 
      shows that the SDR protein colocalizes with the nucleus. 35S:AntiSDR plants are
      hypersensitive to salt stress, but 35S:SDR plants display a salt-tolerant
      phenotype. Furthermore, 35S:SDR plants are hypersensitive to drought stress,
      while 35S:AntiSDR plants are significantly more drought tolerant. Overall, our
      results suggest that SDR is involved in salt and drought stress responses in
      Arabidopsis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A) mRNA modification is essential for
      mammalian and plant viability. The U6 m(6)A methyltransferases in other species
      regulate S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) homeostasis through installing m(6)A in
      pre-mRNAs of SAM synthetases. However, U6 m(6)A methyltransferase has not been
      characterized in Arabidopsis and little is known about its role in regulating
      photomorphogenesis and flowering. RESULTS: Here we characterize that FIONA1 is an
      Arabidopsis U6 m(6)A methyltransferase that installs m(6)A in U6 snRNA and a
      small subset of poly(A)(+) RNA. Disruption of FIONA1 leads to phytochrome
      signaling-dependent hypocotyl elongation and photoperiod-independent early
      flowering. Distinct from mammalian METTL16 and worm METT-10, FIONA1 neither
      installs m(6)A in the mRNAs of Arabidopsis SAM synthetases nor affects their
      transcript expression levels under normal or high SAM conditions. We confirm that
      FIONA1 can methylate plant mRNA m(6)A motifs in vitro and in vivo. We further
      show that FIONA1 installs m(6)A in several phenotypic related transcripts,
      thereby affecting downstream mRNA stability and regulating phytochrome signaling 
      and floral transition. CONCLUSION: FIONA1 is functional as a U6 m(6)A
      methyltransferase in Arabidopsis, distinct from mammalian METTL16 and worm
      METT-10. Our results demonstrate that FIONA1-mediated m(6)A post-transcriptional 
      regulation is an autonomous regulator for flowering and phytochrome
      signaling-dependent photomorphogenesis.

TI  - OTP970 Is Required for RNA Editing of Chloroplast ndhB Transcripts in Arabidopsis
      thaliana.

LID - 10.3390/genes13010139 [doi]
AB  - RNA editing is essential for compensating for defects or mutations in haploid
      organelle genomes and is regulated by numerous trans-factors. Pentatricopeptide
      repeat (PPR) proteins are the prime factors that are involved in RNA editing;
      however, many have not yet been identified. Here, we screened the
      plastid-targeted PLS-DYW subfamily of PPR proteins belonging to Arabidopsis
      thaliana and identified ORGANELLE TRANSCRIPT PROCESSING 970 (OTP970) as a key
      player in RNA editing in plastids. A loss-of-function otp970 mutant was impaired 
      in RNA editing of ndhB transcripts at site 149 (ndhB-C149).
      RNA-immunoprecipitation analysis indicated that OTP970 was associated with the
      ndhB-C149 site. The complementation of the otp970 mutant with OTP970 lacking the 
      DYW domain (OTP970(DYW)) failed to restore the RNA editing of ndhB-C149. ndhB
      gene encodes the B subunit of the NADH dehydrogenase-like (NDH) complex; however,
      neither NDH activity and stability nor NDH-PSI supercomplex formation were
      affected in otp970 mutant compared to the wild type, indicating that alteration
      in amino acid sequence is not necessary for NdhB function. Together, these
      results suggest that OTP970 is involved in the RNA editing of ndhB-C149 and that 
      the DYW domain is essential for its function.

AB  - 13 MBD-containing genes (AtMBD1-13) have been identified in Arabidopsis thaliana 
      so far, however, their DNA binding ability is still controversial. Here, we
      systematically measured the DNA binding affinities of these MBDs by ITC and EMSA 
      binding assays, except for those of pseudogenes AtMBD3 and AtMBD13, and found
      that only AtMBD6 and AtMBD7 function as methylated DNA readers. We also found
      that the MBD of AtMBD5 exhibits very weak binding to methylated DNA compared to
      that of AtMBD6. To further investigate the structural basis of AtMBDs in binding 
      to methylated DNA, we determined the complex structure of the AtMBD6 MBD with a
      12mer mCG DNA and the apo structure of the AtMBD5 MBD. Structural analysis
      coupled with mutagenesis studies indicated that, in addition to the conserved
      arginine fingers contributing to the DNA binding specificity, the residues
      located in the loop1 and alpha1 are also essential for the methylated DNA binding
      of these MBDs in Arabidopsis thaliana, which explains why AtMBD5 MBD and the
      other AtMBDs display very weak or no binding to methylated DNA. Thus, our study
      here systematically demonstrates the DNA binding ability of the MBDs in
      Arabidopsis thaliana, which also provides a general guideline in understanding
      the DNA binding ability of the MBDs in other plants as a whole.

AB  - Hormone signals like auxin play a critical role controlling plant growth and
      development. Determining the mechanisms that regulate auxin distribution in cells
      and tissues is a vital step in understanding this hormone's role during plant
      development. Recent mathematical models have enabled us to understand the
      essential role that auxin influx and efflux carriers play in auxin transport in
      the Arabidopsis root tip (Band et al., Plant Cell 26(3):862-875, 2014; Grieneisen
      et al., Nature 449(7165):1008-1013, 2007; van den Berg et al., Development
      143(18):3350-3362, 2016). In this chapter, we describe SimuPlant: The Virtual
      Root (SimuPlant, University of Nottingham. https://www.simuplant.org/ . Accessed 
      20 Sept 2019); an open source software suite, built using the OpenAlea (Pradal et
      al., Funct Plant Biol 35(10):751-760, 2008) framework, that is designed to
      simulate vertex-based models in real plant tissue geometries. We provide guidance
      on how to install SimuPlant, run 2D auxin transport models in the Arabidopsis
      root tip, manipulate parameters, and visualize model outputs.SimuPlant features a
      graphical user interface (GUI) designed to allow users with no programming
      experience to simulate auxin dynamics within the Arabidopsis root tip. Within the
      user interface, users of SimuPlant can select from a range of model assumptions
      and can choose to manipulate model and simulation parameter values. Users can
      then investigate how their choices affect the predicted distribution of auxin in 
      the Arabidopsis root tip. The results of the model simulations are shown visually
      within the root geometry and can be exported and saved as PNG image files.

TI  - An Arabidopsis vasculature distributed metal tolerance protein facilitates xylem 
      magnesium diffusion to shoots under high-magnesium environments.
PG  - 166-182
LID - 10.1111/jipb.13187 [doi]
AB  - Magnesium (Mg(2+) ) is an essential metal for plant growth; however, its
      over-accumulation in cells can be cytotoxic. The metal tolerance protein family
      (MTP) belongs to an ubiquitous family of cation diffusion facilitator (CDF)
      proteins that export divalent metal cations for metal homeostasis and tolerance
      in all organisms. We describe here the identification of MTP10 to be critical for
      xylem Mg homeostasis in Arabidopsis under high Mg(2+) conditions. The Arabidopsis
      plant contains 12 MTP genes, and only knockout of MTP10 decreased the tolerance
      of high-Mg stress. The functional complementation assays in a Mg(2+)
      -uptake-deficient bacterial strain MM281 confirmed that MTP10 conducted Mg(2+)
      transport. MTP10 is localized to the plasma membrane of parenchyma cells around
      the xylem. Reciprocal grafting analysis further demonstrated that MTP10 functions
      in the shoot to determine the shoot growth phenotypes under high Mg(2+)
      conditions. Moreover, compared to the wild type, the mtp10 mutant accumulated
      more Mg(2+) in xylem sap under high-Mg stress. This study reveals that MTP10
      facilitates Mg(2+) diffusion from the xylem to shoots and thus determines Mg
      homeostasis in shoot vascular tissues during high-Mg stress.

TI  - MicroRNA840 (MIR840) accelerates leaf senescence by targeting the overlapping
      3'UTRs of PPR and WHIRLY3 in Arabidopsis thaliana.
PG  - 126-143
LID - 10.1111/tpj.15559 [doi]
AB  - MicroRNAs negatively regulate gene expression by promoting target mRNA cleavage
      and/or impairing its translation, thereby playing a crucial role in plant
      development and environmental stress responses. In Arabidopsis, the MIR840 gene
      is located within the overlapping 3'UTR of the PPR and WHIRLY3 (WHY3) genes, both
      being predicted targets of miR840* and miR840, the short maturation products of
      MIR840. Gain- and loss-of-function of MIR840 in Arabidopsis resulted in opposite 
      senescence phenotypes. The highest expression levels of the MIR840 precursor
      transcript pre-miR840 were observed at senescence initiation, and pre-miR840
      expression is significantly correlated with a reduction in PPR, but not WHY3,
      transcript levels. Although a reduction of transcript level of PPR, but not WHY3 
      transcript levels were not significantly affected by MIR840 overexpression, its
      protein levels were strongly reduced. Mutating the cleavage sites or replacing
      the target sequences abolishes the miR840*/miR840-mediated degradation of PPR
      transcripts and accumulation of WHY3 protein. In support for this, concurrent
      knockdown of both PPR and WHY3 in wild-type plants resulted in a senescence
      phenotype resembling that of the MIR840-overexpressing plant. This indicates that
      both PRR and WHY3 are targets in the MIR840-mediated senescence pathway.
      Moreover, single knockout mutants of PPR and WHY3 show a convergent upregulated
      subset of senescence-associated genes, which are also found among those induced
      by MIR840 overexpression. Our data provide evidence for a regulatory role of
      MIR840 in plant senescence.

TI  - Cytosolic proline is required for basal freezing tolerance in Arabidopsis.
PG  - 147-155
LID - 10.1111/pce.14196 [doi]
AB  - The amino acid proline accumulates in many plant species under abiotic stress
      conditions, and various protective functions have been proposed. During cold
      stress, however, proline content in Arabidopsis thaliana does not correlate with 
      freezing tolerance. Freezing sensitivity of a starchless plastidic
      phosphoglucomutase mutant (pgm) indicated that localization of proline in the
      cytosol might stabilize the plasma membrane during freeze-thaw events. Here, we
      show that re-allocation of proline from cytosol to vacuole was similar in the
      pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase 2-1 (p5cs2-1) mutant and the pgm mutant and
      caused similar reduction of basal freezing tolerance. In contrast, the starch
      excess 1-1 mutant (sex1-1) had even lower freezing tolerance than pgm but did not
      affect sub-cellular localization of proline. Freezing sensitivity of sex1-1
      mutants affected primarily the photosynthetic electron transport and was enhanced
      in a sex1-1::p5cs2-1 double mutant. These findings indicate that several
      independent factors determine basal freezing tolerance. In a pgm::p5cs2-1 double 
      mutant, freezing sensitivity and proline allocation to the vacuole were the same 
      as in the parental lines, indicating that the lack of cytosolic proline was the
      common cause of reduced basal freezing tolerance in both mutants. We conclude
      that cytosolic proline is an important factor in freezing tolerance of
      non-acclimated plants.

TI  - Nitric oxide signalling in roots is required for MYB72-dependent systemic
      resistance induced by Trichoderma volatile compounds in Arabidopsis.
PG  - 584-595
LID - 10.1093/jxb/erab294 [doi]
AB  - Volatile compounds (VCs) of Trichoderma fungi trigger induced systemic resistance
      (ISR) in Arabidopsis that is effective against a broad spectrum of pathogens. The
      root-specific transcription factor MYB72 is an early regulator of ISR and also
      controls the activation of iron-deficiency responses. Nitric oxide (NO) is
      involved in the regulation of MYB72-dependent iron-deficiency responses in
      Arabidopsis roots, but the role of NO in the regulation of MYB72 and ISR by
      Trichoderma VCs remains unexplored. Using in vitro bioassays, we applied
      Trichoderma VCs to Arabidopsis seedlings. Plant perception of Trichoderma VCs
      triggered a burst of NO in Arabidopsis roots. By suppressing this burst using an 
      NO scavenger, we show the involvement of NO in Trichoderma VCs-mediated
      regulation of MYB72 expression. Using an NO scavenger and the Arabidopsis lines
      myb72 and nia1nia2 in in planta bioassays, we demonstrate that NO signalling is
      required in the roots for activation of Trichoderma VCs-mediated ISR against the 
      leaf pathogen Botrytis cinerea. Analysis of the defence-related genes PR1 and
      PDF1.2 points to the involvement of root NO in priming leaves for enhanced
      defence. Our results support a key role of root NO signalling in the regulation
      of MYB72 expression during the activation of ISR by Trichoderma VCs.

LID - 10.3390/molecules27010161 [doi]
AB  - Abscisic acid (ABA, 1) is a plant hormone that regulates various plant
      physiological processes such as seed developing and stress responses. The ABA
      signaling system has been elucidated; binding of ABA with PYL proteins triggers
      ABA signaling. We have previously reported a new method to isolate a protein
      targeted with a bioactive small molecule using a biotin linker with alkyne and
      amino groups, a protein cross-linker, and a bioactive small molecule with an
      azido group (azido probe). This method was used to identify the unknown ABA
      binding protein of Arabidopsis thaliana. As a result, AtTrxh3, a thioredoxin, was
      isolated as an ABA binding protein. Our developed method can be applied to the
      identification of binding proteins of bioactive compounds.
