Comparing against a corpus formed by NCBI's MeSH term D010944 (Plants) would seem reasonable as they are an authority and follows good practices. The authors could, for instance, obtain MeSH by running pubmed_parser on the files that they already downloaded, and obtain the children terms of D010944 via the definition of MeSH terms downloadable on NCBI/MeSH's ftp server.\"\n",
